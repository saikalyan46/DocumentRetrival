La segunda muerte

La segunda muerte (English "The Second Death") is an Agentinian film from 2014. Its gengre is slightly unclear, but it's indeed a type of horror (or horrific) motion picture combined with a rather slow pace, which also makes it a drama as well. It's style is iconic, since no similar film has been made previously. Not within Hollywood or Europe at least. Catholic faith isn't a necessety for understanding this film, but Catholic faith (or ecumenical basic Christianity) is partly involved in the story, such as Biblical quotations. There are not much of sudden "chocking effects", sooner is the general feeling and mood slowly increasing of something horrific.
The scenery is set a long way from the <a href="Argentine">Argentinian</a> Capital, <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, presumably out on the famous landscape which is known as <a href="Pampas">Pampas</a>. And the story unfoldes around a smaller village and its church. (imdb = 2334715)

A young boy, about 9 or 10 years old, and his adult man (if that man is ther boy's father or not, is unclear) - but while driving on a low trafficated road does atleast the boy see the stange face of a woman, just as a flash lightens up the environment. The day after, is a totally burned body found on the same road. A young good locking female police officer has to deal with the mystery. The forensic doctor sais "it must have been the lightening". But somehow does the boy feel that's all wrong. And the young police officers is suspiciopus as well. And after have talken with the boy, she deceides that the boy and hisa possible dad must stay in the village, for a few days. 
Then a second badly burnt body is found, and this time the forensic doctor cannot blame it on the wheather.
But still he gives the diagnosis "dead by a lightening hit" - again. He simply has no other explination. 
However, the police officer realises that this simply cannot be a question of two flashes from the sky. 
And the young boy appear to see certain things, which he dare not share with the adult man with whoome he's travelling. 
After a third equal death do some of the villagers conclutions of their own, but they do not wish to share their theories with the police. Instead comes the village's priest in focus for them. This time does the forensic analyst suggest "spontan slelf-burning", but the truth is that he hasn't got a clue about what has happened.
The young boy can see some things from the past, and it becomes obvious that something evil have hit the village 30 or 40 years ago. A dead woman has as some kind of ghost returned to the little village, in order to avenge some kind of old injustice.

Theatrum Pictorium

Theatrum Pictorium, or ‘Theatre of Painting’, is a short-hand name of a book published in the 1660s by <a href="David%20Teniers%20the%20Younger">David Teniers the Younger</a> for his employer, the <a href="Archduke%20Leopold%20Wilhelm%20of%20Austria">Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria</a>. It was a catalog of 243 Italian paintings in the Archduke's collection of over 1300 paintings, with engravings of the paintings taken from small models that Teniers had personally prepared. A second edition with page numbers was published in 1673.

During the years 1646-1656 Leopold Wilhelm was governor of the Netherlands and formed one of the greatest art collections of his age. Teniers effectively became its curator after the death of his predecessor <a href="Jan%20van%20den%20Hoecke">Jan van den Hoecke</a> in 1651. Leopold Wilhelm’s collection came to hold works by <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Elder">Hans Holbein the Elder</a>, <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a>, <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>, <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Giorgione">Giorgione</a>, <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Paolo Veronese</a> and more than 15 works by <a href="Titian">Titian</a>.

This archducal collection now forms the heart of Vienna’s <a href="Kunsthistorisches%20Museum">Kunsthistorisches Museum</a>.

Before moving to Vienna in 1659, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm formed his art collection in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, where <a href="David%20Teniers%20the%20Younger">David Teniers the Younger</a> painted views of his Brussels gallery, which are now spread among various collections:
Teniers employed a team of 12 engravers for reproducing the 243 paintings in the Theatrum. He produced small copies in oil of each of the chosen paintings, issuing these as models to his engravers and 120 of which were auctioned by the estate of <a href="John%20Spencer-Churchill%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough</a> in 1886. Teniers’ painted copies measuring approximately 17 x 25 cm are now spread among various collections. The <a href="Courtauld%20Institute%20of%20Art">Courtauld Institute of Art</a> Gallery holds 14 of these works, the largest group in any public collection. Of the 12 engravers, the five who contributed most were <a href="Jan%20van%20Troyen">Jan van Troyen</a> with 56, <a href="Lucas%20Vorsterman%20the%20Younger">Lucas Vorsterman the Younger</a> with 52, <a href="Pieter%20van%20Lisebetten">Pieter van Lisebetten</a> 40, <a href="Theodoor%20van%20Kessel">Theodoor van Kessel</a> 27, and <a href="Coryn%20Boel">Coryn</a> or Quirin Boel 25.

Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook pedestrian bridge

The Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook is a public pedestrian bridge located in the <a href="Amsterdam%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">City of Amsterdam, NY</a>. It is 30 feet wide and spans 511 feet over the Mohawk River. The bridge connects Riverlink Park, which is located on the north shore of the river, to Bridge Street, which is on the south shore. Construction began on the bridge in June 2014 and was opened to the public in August 2016. It features numerous trees and flower plantings, as well as local historical and cultural information engraved into the decking and on plaques along the railings.

The primary source of funding for the project was $16.5 million allocated in the Rebuild and Renew New York Transportation Bond Act of 2005. An additional $1.65 million for artistic elements and other amenities was provided by grants from New York State.

The opening of the bridge was marked by a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 31, 2016. New York Lieutenant Governor <a href="Kathy%20Hochul">Kathy Hochul</a>, Congressman <a href="Paul%20D.%20Tonko">Paul Tonko</a>, State Assemblyman <a href="Angelo%20Santabarbara">Angelo Santabarbara</a>, Montgomery County Executive Matthew Ossenfort, Amsterdam Mayor Michael Villa, and <a href="New%20York%20State%20Canal%20Corporation">New York State Canal Corporation</a> directors William Finch and Brian Stratton, were speakers at the ceremony.

The bridge is maintained by the City of Amsterdam and the New York State Canal Corporation.

The idea to build a pedestrian bridge to connect the north and south sides of the city was proposed in an updated version of the city's comprehensive plan which was released in 2003. <a href="Paul%20D.%20Tonko">Paul Tonko</a>, who was a New York State assemblyman, fought for the inclusion of $16.5 million for the project in the Rebuild and Renew New York Transportation Bond Act of 2005. The act authorized a total of $2.9 billion in borrowing for statewide transportation-related projects and was approved by referendum in November 2005.

The final curved "park over the river" design of the bridge was selected with input from the public after several informational meetings in 2009 and 2010.

Original plans for the bridge included artistic elements such as engraved concrete decking, historical and cultural plaques along the railing, lettering for the city's name on the exterior of the bridge, two circular pieces of artwork at either end of the bridge: a reproduction of the Wheel of Life mosaic, and a compass design, and two large sculptures, one at each entrance to the bridge. These elements were removed from the project due to construction cost increases. Two grants from New York State later funded the additional elements. All the additional elements except for the two large sculptures and the reproduction of the Wheel of Life mosaic were completed in time the bridge's opening in 2016.

Ann Thane, former mayor, and Rob von Hasseln, city historian and former community and economic development director, were credited for their involvement with the artistic cultural and historical elements on the bridge.

In 2015, von Hasseln presented an economic case for the bridge to city residents. Citing statistics from Erie Canal Way National Historic Corridor studies, he proposed that if the bridge drew 30,000 visitors per year, the potential economic impact for local businesses could total $10,210,460 per year, which would generate an additional $408,418 in Montgomery County sales tax, and $64,121 for the city. The visitor estimate was based on the actual number of guest book signers per year at the <a href="Bridge%20of%20Flowers%20%28bridge%29">Bridge of Flowers</a> in Shelborne Falls, MA. Von Hasseln said that given Sheborne’s lower regional population, greater distance from a major highway, and lack of any other major attractions in comparison to the Amsterdam location, that he saw no reason why the MVGO shouldn’t at least be able to draw the same numbers.

In 2007, both the Amsterdam Industrial Development Agency and the Amsterdam Common Council passed resolutions calling on state lawmakers and the Canal Corporation to redirect the funds for the bridge to infrastructure improvement projects, demolition, establishing a railroad quiet zone and other economic development projects.

Joe Emanuele, who was mayor at the time and is a current member of AIDA, said in regards to the grant money, “We’re just asking the legislature to reconsider… we’re not refusing it, but asking if we can redirect funds to more needy projects.”

<a href="George%20A.%20Amedore%20Jr.">George Amedore</a>, a New York State assemblyman at the time, said, “A pedestrian bridge will not bring economic growth to Amsterdam.”

In 2009, a petition was circulated among city residents which called for the funds to be redirected to projects such as a walkway between Guy Park Manor and Riverlink Park, or adding pedestrian access to the existing Lock 11 bridge.

Ann Thane, who was mayor at the time, advocated for the continuation of the project and said “I think that the city has a tremendous gift here and this is going to be a wonderful economic development driver.”

Carmella Mantello, who was director of the Canal Corporation at the time said a redistribution of the funds wasn’t possible.

Saratoga Associates, of Saratoga, NY provided the architectural design for the bridge, which won the 2016 Engineering Project of the Year award from the Capital District Chapter of the New York State Society of Professional Engineers. <a href="Ammann%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney">Ammann & Whitney</a> was the Engineer of Record for the project, MJ Engineering and Land Surveying was the civil engineer and surveyor, and D.A. Collins was a major construction contractor.

"Success is about making a positive impact. I am an engineer by chance, teacher by choice and an entrepreneur by chance. I did not start this to make money. I started doing what I really loved, it made an impact and became a business," said the founder of the namesake education technology startup, Byju's.
He started teaching because he knew how to crack the much-feared CAT exam. The trick, according to the 35-year-old, is simple — learn the how and why of the question.When he went to write the CAT exam, he didn't fill the form, his friends filled and they told that it's like a picnic, they'll go write and come. Byju also went without any preparation but he got high distinction with 100%. "The idea is to make learning contextual and visual. It is important to show the how to learn."

The application which has garnered a huge student base has received funding from Facebook's CEO's Chan Zuckerberg Foundation.

Eugene Coste

Canadian born but Paris-educated, Eugene Marius Coste is known as the “Father of Natural Gas in Canada.” He became the first to produce and deliver natural gas in commercial quantities in Alberta. Born in July 1859 in <a href="Amherstburg%2C%20Ontario">Amherstburg, Ontario</a>, Eugene was the middle son of Napoleon Alexandre Coste and Mathilde Robidoux. His father was a native of <a href="Marseilles%2C%20France">Marseilles, France</a>, who had gone to sea and then jumped ship at Amherstburg.

In the <a href="nineteenth%20century">nineteenth century</a>, the inorganic school of thought argued that unknown processes operating at great depth in the earth produced petroleum, and that its occurrence was associated with volcanic activity. Eugene Coste stoutly held this view.

Armed with a mining engineering degree from the École National Supérieure des Mines in Paris, Coste worked with the Geological Survey of Canada for six years before embarking upon a career as an independent mining engineer.

After reading a <a href="geology">geology</a> report that associated <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> deposits with an <a href="anticline">anticline</a> structure in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, in 1889 Coste chose the site for his first drilling attempt in <a href="Essex%20County%2C%20Ontario">Essex County, Ontario</a>. In 1889 he brought in the first producing gas well in Essex County. His work in that area eventually led to the formation of the Ontario utility, <a href="Union%20Gas">Union Gas</a>. The reservoir he discovered became known as the Essex gas field and by 1894 included approximately thirty wells. In 1890 he began to export natural gas to <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>, from a well near <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara Falls, Ontario</a>. By 1895, his United Gas and Oil Company was delivering hydrocarbons to Ontario communities, and also to American consumers on the Detroit side of the river.

Later in his life, Coste moved west and drilled the locally famous <a href="Old%20Glory">Old Glory</a> gas well near Bow Island, Alberta, in 1909. In 1912, his Canadian Western natural Gas Company built a 280-kilometre pipeline connecting his <a href="Bow%20Island%20gas%20field">Bow Island gas field</a> to <a href="Lethbridge">Lethbridge</a> and <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>. It augmented the Dingman enterprise in Calgary, which was unable to supply the growing demands of the city. By 1913, several other towns in southern Alberta also boasted natural gas service from the Canadian Western system and Coste's pioneering enterprise provided fuel to nearly 7,000 customers.

Based on the 1978 film <a href="Grease%20%28film%29">Grease</a> (which itself is based on the 1971 musical <a href="Grease%20%28musical%29">of the same name</a>), the game requires either <a href="PlayStation%20Move">PlayStation Move</a> or <a href="Xbox%20Kinect">Xbox Kinect</a>. The game also includes 20 songs, 15 of which are from the original movie. It is the second game to be based on "Grease", following 2010's "<a href="Grease%20%28video%20game%29">Grease</a>", which was partially created by the same developer.

The title's standard mode is "Dance" which has players mimicking motions that appear on the screen to music using either a PlayStation Move or Kinect (depending on the console). Only 15 of the game's 20 songs are available to dance to. In multiplayer, players may complete head to head or perform a coop dance routine. One competitive mode exclusive to multiplayer is "Challenge", which has players performing a dance routine while also completing small tasks throughout the song, such as freezing in place for a set number of time. Also available is Karaoke, which allows players to use a USB microphone or the built in mics on the <a href="PlayStation%20Eye">PlayStation Eye</a> or Kinect to sing the song as it plays. Up to eight players may play at once using "Party mode", in which two teams consisting of two singers and two dancers face off against each other. In all modes, players can earn a score multiplier by completing five or more pages with an "Ok" or higher rating, which increases the amount of points earned for a move.

Players can also unlock film clips and mini-games based on movie scenes to play, most of which don't involve the core aspect of dancing or singing. For example, the "Thunder Road Race" mini-game is a race course in which players use hand gestures to boost and steer their car in a head to head race with the computer.

The game was shown by publisher 505 Games at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202011">2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> as part of their Kinect exhibit, which also included games such as "<a href="Blackwater%20%28video%20game%29">Blackwater</a>" and "Michael Phelps: Push the Limit". The PlayStation 3 version uses <a href="AiLive%23LiveMove%202">LiveMove 2</a> technology. "Grease Dance" was released on disc on 
October 25, 2011 in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, with and <a href="Australia">Australian</a> and <a href="Europe">European</a> release coming on November 3 and November 4, respectively. The game was released as a download title on the <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> in the three regions on June 26, 2012.

"Grease Dance" received mixed to negative reviews upon release. <a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a> awarded the Xbox 360 version a 6/10, with the UK version of the magazine giving the game a 7/10. Push Square reviewed the PlayStation 3 version, giving it a 5/10.

HD 164922 c

HD 164922 c is an <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a> orbiting the star <a href="HD%20164922">HD 164922</a> about 72 <a href="light-year">light-years</a> from Earth in the constellation <a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Hercules</a>. The exoplanet was found by using the <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">radial velocity method</a>, from <a href="radial%20velocity">radial-velocity</a> measurements via observation of <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shifts</a> in the <a href="spectrum">spectrum</a> of the <a href="planet">planet's</a> parent star.

HD 164922 c is a <a href="mini-Neptune">mini-Neptune</a>, an exoplanet that has a radius and mass in between that of a <a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a> and the planet <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> with no solid surface. It has a temperature of . It has an estimated mass of around 12.9 , and a potential radius of around 3.5 based on its similar mass to Neptune.

The planet orbits a (<a href="Stellar%20classification%23Class%20G">G-type</a>) <a href="star">star</a> named <a href="HD%20164922">HD 164922</a>. The star has a mass of 0.87 and a radius of around 0.99 . It has a temperature of 5293 <a href="Kelvin">K</a> and is 13.4 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is metal-rich, with a <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> ([Fe/H]) of 0.16, or 144% the solar amount. This is particularly odd for a star as old as HD 164922. Its luminosity () is 70% of the solar luminosity.

The star's <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 7.01. Therefore, HD 164922 is too dim to be seen with the naked eye, but can be viewed using good binoculars.

HD 164922 c orbits its star every 75 days at a distance of 0.335 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a> (close to <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>'s orbital distance from the Sun, which is 0.38 AU). It receives more than 6 times as much <a href="stellar%20flux">sunlight</a> as the Earth does from the Sun.

The search for HD 164922 c started when its host star was chosen an ideal target for a planet search using the <a href="radial%20velocity%20method">radial velocity method</a> (in which the gravitational pull of a planet on its star is measured by observing the resulting <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a>), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">Doppler spectroscopy</a> measurements. It was also confirmed that HD 164922 is neither a binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common <a href="false%20positive">false positives</a> when searching for transiting planets. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated the existence of a planet. The net result was an estimate of a 12.9 planetary companion orbiting the star at a distance of 0.33 AU with an eccentricity of 0.07.

The discovery of HD 164922 c was reported in the online archive <a href="arXiv">arXiv</a> on June 30, 2016.

Maha Pyauk of Yamethin

Maha Pyauk (, ; d. November 1400) was governor of <a href="Yamethin">Yamethin</a> and a key army commander from 1395/96 to 1400. He emerged as one of the pretenders to the <a href="Ava%20Kingdom">Ava</a> throne after King <a href="Tarabya%20of%20Ava">Tarabya</a>'s assassination. But Pyauk himself was assassinated by Prince <a href="Theiddat">Theiddat</a>, who wanted his elder brother <a href="Minkhaung%20I">Minkhaung</a> to succeed.

Pyauk was a younger brother of Governor-General <a href="Thilawa%20of%20Yamethin">Thilawa of Yamethin</a>. After Thilawa's death in 1395/96, King <a href="Swa%20Saw%20Ke">Swa Saw Ke</a> of Ava appointed Pyauk to be the next governor of Yamethin as well as the commander of the army Thilawa previously commanded. According to the <a href="Burmese%20chronicles">royal chronicles</a>, Pyauk took command of an army consisted of 60 elephants, 800 cavalry and 10,000 men. 

Pyauk became a pretender to the throne in November 1400 when King Tarabya was assassinated just seven months in office. The court led by <a href="Min%20Yaza%20of%20Wun%20Zin">Min Yaza</a> executed the assassin Gov. <a href="Thihapate%20of%20Tagaung">Thihapate of Tagaung</a>, and selected <a href="Minkhaung%20I">Minkhaung</a>, another son of Swa. But Minkhaung, who did not command an army, was concerned about Pyauk, and told the court to offer the throne to Pyauk instead. But Minkhaung's younger brother <a href="Theiddat">Theiddat</a> disagreed with his brother's decision. As Pyauk marched with his large army to Ava to take over the throne, Theiddat and his small army ambushed Pyauk near Pinya, and successfully assassinated Pyauk. 

After Pyauk's death, Minkhaung ascended the throne on 25 November 1400. The new king appointed Min Yaza's son <a href="Sithu%20of%20Yamethin">Pauk Hla</a> governor of Yamethin.

The Nouveau marché (New Market) was a French equity market that was a division of the <a href="Paris%20Bourse">Paris Bourse</a>, now called <a href="Euronext%20Paris">Euronext Paris</a>.

The Nouveau marché was founded in 1996 to facilitate access to the financial market by new start-ups with high growth potential but insufficient financing. Only newly formed companies were allowed access to the Nouveau marché, which was envisioned as a French equivalent to <a href="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

Created simultaneously with the Nouveau marché was a German counterpart, <a href="Neuer%20Market">Neuer Market</a>, and a British counterpart, the <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">Alternative Investment Market</a>.

To be allowed on the Nouveau marché, companies needed a minimum of 1.5 million euros in capital, among other requirements.

Most of the companies listed on the Nouveau marché companies were in the technology sector.

A November 2000 article in the "<a href="Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>" stated that the Nouveau marché was “headed into hibernation.” During the first half of the year, there had been 40 initial public offerings, but during the rest of the year only eight IPOs had been added to the market. According to “market watchers,” wrote Mathilde Richter, “Nouveau Marche IPOs are going to become as rare as black truffles.” The problem, she explained, was a “glutted” IPO market and investors who had “tired of unprofitable Internet companies coming to market and disappointing at earnings season.” Richter quoted Francois Dubrule of the Paris-based venture-capital fund Angel Invest as saying that the market was “saturated.” In short, the “rosy days” of the Nouveau marché were apparently over.

On February 21, 2005, Euronext Paris created a single regulated market, <a href="Eurolist">Eurolist</a>, to replace the <a href="Premier%20March%C3%A9">Premier Marché</a>, <a href="Second%20March%C3%A9">Second Marché</a>, and Nouveau Marché.

1917 Bath Riots

1917 Bath Riots occurred in January 1917 at the Santa Fe Bridge between <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a> and <a href="Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20Mexico">Juárez, Mexico</a>. The riots lasted from January 28 to January 30th and were sparked by new immigration policies at the <a href="El%20Paso%E2%80%93Ju%C3%A1rez">El Paso–Juárez</a> <a href="Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Service">Immigration and Naturalization Service</a> office, requiring Mexicans crossing the border to take de-lousing baths and be vaccinated. Reports of nude photography of women bathers and fear of potential fire from the kerosene baths led Carmelita Torres to refuse to submit to the procedure. Denied a refund of her transport fare, she began yelling at the officials and convinced other riders to join her. After three days, the discontent subsided, but the disinfections of Mexicans at the U.S. border continued for forty years. 

By 1914, <a href="Venustiano%20Carranza">Venustiano Carranza</a> had been sworn into office as Mexico's head of state ending the main fighting of the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>. President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, tired of the fighting and more concerned with events unfolding in Europe and <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, withdrew American forces from Mexico. <a href="Pancho%20Villa">Pancho Villa</a> refused to give up the fight and continued to execute border skirmishes. Between 1915 and 1917, <a href="typhus">typhus</a> (which was sometimes reported as <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>) spread from <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> to the provinces from <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> to <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>. In September 1916, Carranza called for a constitutional convention to end the conflict and bring peace to Mexico. The convention ended simultaneously with the end of the riots, on January 31, 1917, and subsequently the new constitution was signed on February 5th.

During the same period, <a href="Thomas%20Calloway%20Lea%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Calloway Lea, Jr.</a> was elected as mayor of <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>. Lea sent telegrams to <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senators</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.%20C.">Washington</a> demanding a <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> be put in place to stem the tide of "dirty lousey destitute Mexicans" who would spread typhus into El Paso. Though the <a href="Public%20Health%20Service">Public Health Service</a> Officer for El Paso, Dr. B. J. Lloyd, admitted there was little danger and opposed a quarantine, he suggested opening de-lousing plants. U.S. officials quickly adopted a policy of <a href="Sanitation">sanitizing</a> Mexican immigrants at a disinfecting station in El Paso. The policy initially applied to all Mexicans entering the United States at El Paso, but soon spread to the <a href="Laredo%E2%80%93Nuevo%20Laredo">Laredo–Nuevo Laredo</a> crossing, as well as all along the U.S. Mexico border.

Men and women were separated, with any children accompanying the women, into separate buildings, where they were stripped of all clothing and valuables. Clothing and valuables were steamed, while items like shoes, hats or belts, which might be damaged by steam were exposed to <a href="Cyanogen">cyanogen gas</a>. Attendants examined the nude persons for <a href="lice">lice</a>. If lice were found, men's hair was clipped close to the head and the clippings were burned. Women's hair was doused in a mixture of <a href="vinegar">vinegar</a> and <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a>, wrapped in a towel, and left on the hair for at least 30 minutes. If re-inspection indicated all nits had not been removed, the process was repeated. Once attendants declared the lice test had been "passed", the naked people were gathered in a bathing area and sprayed with a liquid soap made of soap chips and kerosene oil. After collecting their sanitized clothing and dressing, incomers were evaluated by a foreman, vaccinated and given a certificate that they had completed the procedure. From the disinfecting area, migrants then entered the <a href="Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Service">Immigration and Naturalization Service</a> building for processing.

Around 7:30 a.m. on January 28, 1917, the riot began when inspectors attempted to remove Mexican women from their <a href="Cable%20car%20%28railway%29">trolley</a>, which they were riding to work. Ordered to disembark and submit to the disinfection process, Carmelita Torres refused, having heard reports that nude women were being photographed while in the baths. Reports had also circulated that bathers might be set on fire, as had happened the previous year when gasoline baths at the El Paso City Jail had resulted in the death of 28 inmates when a cigarette ignited bathers. She requested permission to enter without submitting to bathing and was refused. She then demanded a refund of her <a href="fare">fare</a> and upon refusal of a refund convinced the other women on her cable car to protest. The women began shouting and hurling stones at health and immigration officials, sentries and civilians, who had gathered to watch the disturbance. The majority of the early protesters were young, <a href="maid">domestic workers</a> employed in homes in El Paso but as the crowd grew to several thousand a mixture of people became involved. Four trolley's which had made early morning runs to collect workers on the Juárez side were seized and did not return to the El Paso side until mid-afternoon. 

Around 10 o'clock, General Andrés G. García drove to the center of the bridge to try to quiet the mob and was only partially successful, as the mob tried to prevent his car from leaving the Mexican side. By the afternoon, when it was clear that those who had entered the baths were not being harmed, the crowds were finally dispersed by mounted soldiers on each side of the border. One cable car <a href="motorman">motorman</a> and a <a href="mail%20coach">mail coach</a> driver were reported to have been beaten by rioters and several media movie makers were attacked. Despite rumors that someone had been shot, Mexican authorities denied the event and reported that no serious injuries resulted.

On the 29th rioting continued, but this time, the majority of rioters were men. Newspapers reported that the men were taking advantage of the bath disturbance to protest the Carranza regime and voice support for his rival Pancho Villa. Juárez Police Chief Maximo Torres ordered all rioters arrested and the Mexican cavalry dispersed the rioters from the bridge. Business owners and households who were without laborers consulted with the Chamber of Commerce to resolve the issues promptly as most workers refused to come to work. Officials clarified that those who were not infected could be passed without having to bathe and that certificates were valid for a week.
By January 30, precautionary measures taken by authorities on both sides of the border had quelled the rioting. Two men and one woman were arrested at the American side of the bridge for assaulting a customs officer and an infantryman, but no further violence was reported. Policemen from Juárez monitored the southern end of the bridge crossing, a Mexican health inspector Andrés García was present to maintain respectful treatment at the disinfection plant, and street car service between the two cities was suspended. Notices had been posted in Juárez to advise that the inspectors in El Paso would accept health certificates issued by Mexican health inspectors.

Though hailed by some as the "Latina <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a>", Carmelita Torres was mostly forgotten and her actions had little lasting effect. The <a href="Immigration%20Act%20of%201917">Immigration Act of 1917</a> passed just days after the riot and imposed barriers for Mexican laborers entering the United States. For the first time in history, workers were required to pass literacy tests, pay a head tax and were forbidden to perform contract labor. Business owners in the <a href="Southwestern%20United%20States">Southwest</a> pressed Congress to exempt Mexican workers from contract labor restrictions and head taxes. After the U.S. entered <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> businessmen were able to lift the 1917 Immigration terms for Mexican workers and the exemption lasted until 1921. However, the bathing and fumigations, which later used <a href="insecticides">insecticides</a> and <a href="DDT">DDT</a> continued into the 1950s. A similar riot the following year was averted when prompt action by Mexican authorities intervened with American authorities. Reports of a typhus death in Juárez were denied by Mexicans and the port and trolleys were temporarily closed to prevent altercations.

In 2006, David Dorado Romo published "Ringside Seat to a Revolution" which brought the story back to the attention of the public and Chicano scholars. <a href="NPR">National Public Radio</a> featured a story on the riots in 2006.

Boomerang (Lali song)

"Boomerang" is a song recorded by Argentine singer and actress <a href="Lali%20Esp%C3%B3sito">Lali Espósito</a> serving as the third single for her second studio album "<a href="Soy%20%28Lali%20Esp%C3%B3sito%20album%29">Soy</a>" and was released on September 4, 2016. The song is a Spanish version of the original by <a href="Ayak%20Thiik">Ayak Thiik</a> and Will Simm, written by Espósito along with the music producers Pablo Akselrad, Luis Burgio and Gustavo Novello, and was produced by 3musica and Simm.

Espósito had confirmed the name of the track in an interview in "<a href="Animales%20Sueltos">Animales Sueltos</a>" on March 11, 2016. It was released along with the full album on May 20, 2016 and was sent to radio on September 4, 2016 as its third single. Lyrically, the song talks about the constant criticism and fallacies that Espósito must face. Facing with these situations, the teen idol warns that everything returns like a boomerang.

Espósito performed a medley of "Boomerang", "<a href="Unico%20%28song%29">Unico</a>" and "<a href="Soy%20%28song%29">Soy</a>" at <a href="Susana%20Gim%C3%A9nez%20%28TV%20show%29">Susana Giménez</a> on August 7, 2016. On August 13, 2016 the singer performed the song along with "Unico", "Soy", "<a href="Mil%20A%C3%B1os%20Luz%20%28Lali%20Esp%C3%B3sito%20song%29">Mil Años Luz</a>" and "<a href="A%20Bailar%20%28Lali%20Esp%C3%B3sito%20song%29">A Bailar</a>" at the charity TV special "Un Sol para los Chicos". "Boomerang" is also part of Espósito's second worldwide tour's setlist, titled "<a href="Soy%20Tour">Soy Tour</a>".

On the previous week of the video's release, Espósito had shared small advances trough her Instagram account where it can be seen a lot of transformations, going from brunette to blonde, female to male, humor and with the society's appearances. Directed by Juan Ripari, the music video made its premiere on September 7, 2016 on <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a>. In the video, Espósito mocks and laughs at fame, her behaviors in the press and situations in society. With different characters of society, the singer shows how they consume as true information media and social networks and makes the whole video like a parody. The video also refers to the pressures exerted by the media to be shown always cute and stoic: "She's there and nothing's gonna defeat her". The video was filmed on two full shooting sessions and the characterization of each character took about three hours.

As for the critical reception, Mayte Urrutia from "Pop en Español" praised Espósito's dancing and acting abilities by saying: "Lali not only has showed her beauty, her talent for dance alone and escorted by a group of dancers, but "[the video]" is also very frequent humor". In a post by the argentian website "Cadena3", it was written: "it denotes a huge production and staging, and also the talent that "[Espósito]" has to portray different characters and show her funniest side". <a href="Perez%20Hilton">Perez Hilton</a> described "Boomerang" as "a fun Latin pop song" and also compared the video with <a href="Katy%20Perry">Katy Perry</a>'s "<a href="Birthday%20%28Katy%20Perry%20song%29">Birthday</a>".

Quneitra offensive (September 2016)

The Quneitra offensive (September 2016) was launched by Syrian rebel forces, during the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a>, in order to capture the government-held town of <a href="Hader%2C%20Quneitra%20Governorate">Hader, Quneitra Governorate</a>.

On 10 September, <a href="Jabhat%20Fateh%20al-Sham">Jabhat Fateh al-Sham</a> (formerly the <a href="al-Nusra%20Front">al-Nusra Front</a>), along with <a href="Ansar%20Bait%20al-Maqdis">Ansar Bait al-Maqdis</a> and <a href="Ahrar%20al-Sham">Ahrar al-Sham</a>, launched an offensive at the town of <a href="Khan%20Arnabah">Khan Arnabah</a> on the border with the Golan Heights. Hours later, the rebels took one checkpoint and a hill, but according to pro-government sources, failed to capture another hill and were repelled by pro-government forces.

Meanwhile, the fighting caused stray shells to land at the northern Golan Heights and in response, Israel bombed a <a href="Syrian%20Army">Syrian Army</a> <a href="artillery">artillery</a> position in Quneitra.

The next day, the rebels made advances at the village of Homirat, seizing a large part of its eastern flank, mainly Tal Al-Hamirat hill. At the same time, the main rebel attack towards Hader, at the Tal Taranjeh hilltop, was repelled after a three-hour battle. Rebel forces also reportedly suffered heavy losses after entering a minefield near Tal Gren hill. This included the destruction of two <a href="BMP-1">BMP</a> <a href="Infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">infantry fighting vehicles</a>.

On 12 September, the Army reportedly recaptured all positions they had previously lost, including Tal Al-Hamirat. Later in the day, despite the official start of a country-wide cease-fire, the rebels launched a new, much larger, assault. The rebels once again assaulted Tal Taranjeh hill, but were again beaten back after 10 hours of fighting.

The next day, the <a href="Syrian%20Air%20Defense%20Force">Syrian Air Defense Force</a> launched two <a href="surface%20to%20air%20missile">surface to air missiles</a> at two <a href="Israeli%20Air%20Force">Israeli Air Force</a> aircraft flying over Quneitra. The Syrian state media <a href="Syrian%20Arab%20News%20Agency">Syrian Arab News Agency</a> claimed to have shot down the plane and drone, but the IAF denied this.

On 14 September, a new rebel attack on Tal Taranjeh was beaten back by the Syrian Army. Despite the official ceasefire, both sides continued to shell each other during 17 September, with one stray mortar shell hitting Israeli territory. This led the Israeli Air Force to retaliate by striking the Golan Regiment's positions near Hader. Hours later, the rebels launched a new attack on the government-held Battalion 4 Hill, which was repelled.

Kimaiyo Sego

Kimaiyo Keroney Arap Sego (born September 1952) is a lawyer and a former prominent politician from <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>. Between 1988 and 1992, he served as <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for <a href="Tinderet%20Constituency">Tinderet Constituency</a> and briefly as Minister of Commerce in the <a href="Moi">Moi</a> government. He also served as Chairman of the Kenyan National Anti-corruption Campaign Steering committee.

Kimaiyo Arap Sego was born in 1952 in Kilibwoni location, <a href="Tinderet_Constituency">Tinderet constituency</a>, <a href="Nandi%20County">Nandi County</a> to Sylvester Sego and Felister Sego, a farmer. His father served in the <a href="King%27s%20African%20Rifles">King’s African Rifles</a> (KAR) as a soldier of the <a href="battalion">battalion</a> during the <a href="East_African_Campaign_%28World_War_II%29">East African campaign</a> of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. 
During his early years, he was educated at Kapchemoiywo Primary School. He later joined the prestigious <a href="Kapsabet%20High%20School">Kapsabet High School</a> for his <a href="O-levels">O-levels</a> and together with his younger brother Alexander Kiplimo Sego, were among the first students from <a href="Tinderet%20Constituency">Tinderet</a> to be accepted into the prestigious boy’s high school. He is also one of the prominent Old Boys of the school.

He later studied Law at the <a href="University%20of%20Nairobi">University of Nairobi’s</a> School of Law and was admitted to the bar in 1973.

Arap Sego launched his political bid for the <a href="Tinderet%20Constituency">Tinderet Constituency</a> parliamentary seat during the <a href="Kenyan_general_election%2C_1988">1988 general elections</a>. He won by a land-slide victory, trouncing the incumbent and two time MP <a href="Henry%20Kosgey">Henry Kosgey</a>. After the elections, he was appointed by then <a href="Daniel%20Toroitich%20arap%20Moi">President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi</a> to the cabinet as Minister of Commerce. During his tenure, he oversaw the amendment of the Trade Licensing Act which promoted the growth of domestic industries and as Minister, he represented Kenya in the <a href="Uruguay%20Round">Uruguay Round</a> of the <a href="Multilateral_trade_negotiations">WTO Multilateral Trade Negotiations</a> under the auspices of <a href="GATT">GATT</a>. His Ministerial tenure, however ended prematurely when he was sacked just after nine months in office by <a href="Moi">Moi</a> and replaced by fellow <a href="Nandi%20people">Nandi</a> MP John Cheruiyot. 

Reasons for his dismissal have been a source of much debate as regards the unconstitutional sweeping powers of the presidency. Political analysts such as Lynch observe that the grounds for his sacking were political since at the time, “Moi sustained internecine battles so that politicians expended much of their energy on fighting one another rather than on expanding their local support base.” 

During the first <a href="Kenyan_general_election%2C_1992">multi-party national elections in Kenya in 1992</a>, he defected from the ruling political party <a href="Kenya_African_National_Union">Kenya African National Union (KANU)</a> and joined the opposition party <a href="Democratic_Party_%28Kenya%29">DP</a>. This move proved a costly political decision. Whilst en route to submit his nomination papers for the <a href="Tinderet%20Constituency">Tinderet</a> seat on a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28Kenya%29">DP Party</a> ticket, he was attacked and escaped narrowly. He later lost the election to <a href="Henry%20Kosgey">Henry Kosgey</a>.

After spending a number of years away from the public spotlight, he resumed public service in 2003 when he was appointed as Delegate to the National Constitutional Conference. <a href="Constitutional_reforms_in_Kenya">The Bomas conference</a> was created under the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission Act with the objective of <a href="Constitutional%20reforms%20in%20Kenya">reforming the 1969 Kenyan Constitution</a>. Arap Sego served in the Technical Working Committee K which was in charge of Constitutional Commission and Amendments to the Constitution.

In 2005, he was appointed as Chairman of the National Anti-corruption Campaign Steering Committee (NACCSC) created in May 2004 to spearhead the fight against corruption in Kenya. He successfully led anti-corruption campaigns across the country and headed the committee until 2014. 
Arap Sego currently runs a private law practice in <a href="Nandi%20County">Nandi County</a> in <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>.

The character is one of three thieves that become the target of their proposed victim. Levy's performance was generally been well received by critics.

In "<a href="Don%27t%20Breathe">Don't Breathe</a>", Rocky dreams of escaping from life with her alcoholic mother and moving to California with her younger sister. She is a thief that breaks into houses with her thuggish partner Money and gentle friend, Alex and they sell the items that they steal for money. Alex’s dad works for a home security firm, so Alex has access to house keys and insider information on how to bypass alarms. However, his reason for helping is mainly because of the feelings that he has for Rocky.
One day, Money learns of an Army veteran (the Blind Man) that lives in an abandoned Detroit neighborhood. He has $300,000 in cash in his house, given as a settlement after a wealthy young woman, Cindy Roberts, killed his daughter in a car accident. Discovering that all of the entrances are locked, Rocky climbs through a small window and lets the other two into the house. The group search the house for the money but are unable to find it; assuming it is behind a locked door, Money shoots the lock. The noise wakes up the Blind Man, who kills Money. Rocky hides in a closet. After he leaves, Alex finds Rocky in the closet, and the two open the safe and take the money. Rocky and Alex evade the killer and find a door leading to the basement. Inside they discover a gagged woman in a cell. They realize that she is Cindy, held captive by the Blind Man. They free her and run towards the storm cellar door, only to be surprised by the Blind Man, who fires at them, mistakenly killing Cindy. They manage to escape into the cellar while the killer shuts off all of the lights. Rocky tries to escape the house through the ventilation system. The Blind Man's dog pursues Rocky through the vents, and she is captured. She wakes up tied up in the basement, where the Blind Man reveals that Cindy was impregnated with his child in order to replace the one that she killed. He then attempts to artificially inseminate Rocky with a turkey baster, but Alex knocks him out and handcuffs him. Rocky and Alex can't call the police, as their blood is all over the house, so they attempt to leave through the front door. The Blind Man escapes his restraints and fatally shoots Alex, but Rocky escapes, pursued by the dog. She traps the dog in her car trunk, but is captured again. Rocky disorients the Blind Man by setting off his house's loud alarm system, then beats him attacks him and knocks him into the basement and flees before the police arrive. Rocky is set to leave Detroit on a train to Los Angeles with her sister. She later sees a news report stating that the Blind Man is in stable condition at the hospital. After seeing the report, Rocky leaves the cafe with her sister and they hurry toward the departure gate.

<doc id="51570542" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51570542" title="320th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)">
320th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)

The 320th Rifle Division was formed in September, 1941, as a standard <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> rifle division, based on an existing division of <a href="militia">militia</a>. This formation was devastated in the Kerch Peninsula in May, 1942, and officially disbanded before the end of the month. A second division began forming in the Transcaucasus in August, and served for the duration in the southern regions of the Soviet-German front. It distinguished itself in the liberation of <a href="Yenakiieve">Yenakiyevo</a> in March, 1943, but also suffered massive losses, including the death of the division's commanding officer, along the <a href="Dniester%20River">Dniestr River</a> in May, 1944. A substantially rebuilt division soldiered on through the Balkans, ending the war near Vienna.

The division first formed on Sept. 24, 1941 from the 1st Crimea Militia Division at <a href="Feodosiya">Feodosiya</a>. Its basic order of battle was as follows:
The division was assigned to <a href="51st%20Army%20%28Russia%29">51st Army</a> of <a href="Crimean%20Front">Crimean Front</a> but was still forming up in late October when the German <a href="11th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">11th Army</a> broke into the Crimea from the north, and the remnants of the 320th had to be evacuated across the <a href="Kerch%20Strait">Kerch Strait</a> to the North Caucasus on Nov. 16. During January and February 1942 the division was rebuilt in the <a href="North%20Caucasus%20Military%20District">North Caucasus Military District</a>, and in March returned to the <a href="Kerch%20Peninsula">Kerch Peninsula</a> following the successful Soviet amphibious landings there. It was all for naught, as the German forces launched their <a href="Operation%20Bustard%20Hunt">Operation Bustard Hunt</a> on May 8. At this time the division was part of <a href="47th%20Army">47th Army</a>, and like most of its army it was chopped to pieces in one of the most lopsided German victories of the war. On May 19 the 320th was officially disbanded in Crimean Front.

A new division began forming on Aug. 5, 1942 at <a href="Gyumri">Leninakan</a>, Armenia, in the <a href="Transcaucasus%20Military%20District">Transcaucasus Military District</a>. Its order of battle remained the same as the 1st Formation. By the end of August the 320th was assigned to the <a href="45th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">45th Army</a> in the <a href="Transcaucasus%20Front">Transcaucasus Front</a>, on the southern borders of the USSR and away from the fighting fronts. In October it was assigned to the Northern Group of this front, but remained in reserve until the end of the year. As the German forces withdrew northwards following their defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a>, the division followed up in the <a href="44th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">44th Army</a>, liberating the town of <a href="Azov">Azov</a> on Feb. 7, 1943. By the end of the month the 320th, along with its army, was transferred to <a href="Southern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Southern Front</a>. In July the division went into the <a href="Reserve%20of%20the%20Supreme%20High%20Command">Reserve of the Supreme High Command</a>, then returned to the front at the end of August, still in Southern Front, but now under command of <a href="9th%20Rifle%20Corps">9th Rifle Corps</a> in <a href="5th%20Shock%20Army">5th Shock Army</a>.

During the <a href="Donbass%20Strategic%20Offensive%20%28August%201943%29">Donbass Strategic Offensive</a>, Southern Front finally broke through the German defenses along the <a href="Mius-Front">Mius River</a> and began exploiting into the Donbass region. The city of <a href="Yenakiieve">Yenakiyevo</a> was liberated on Sept. 3, and the 320th, for its efforts, was given this name as an honorific. When Southern Front became <a href="4th%20Ukrainian%20Front">4th Ukrainian Front</a> on Oct. 20, the division, still in 9th Corps, was reassigned to <a href="28th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">28th Army</a>. That army was shifted to <a href="3rd%20Ukrainian%20Front">3rd Ukrainian Front</a> in February, 1944, but the 320th, now in <a href="10th%20Guards%20Rifle%20Corps">10th Guards Rifle Corps</a>, found itself back in 5th Shock Army in March, which by this time was in 3rd Ukrainian Front. During this period, the division's antitank battalion was completely reequipped with <a href="76%20mm%20divisional%20gun%20M1942%20%28ZiS-3%29">ZIS-3 76mm cannon</a>, replacing the <a href="45%20mm%20anti-tank%20gun%20M1942%20%28M-42%29">45mm pieces</a> it had had previously.

By May, the <a href="First%20Jassy-Kishinev%20Offensive">Soviet offensive</a> to break in to Romanian territory towards the cities of Jassy and Kishinev had bogged down along the <a href="Dniester%20River">Dniestr River</a>. Units of 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts had seized bridgeheads at several points in April, but they were shallow, marshy, and, in some cases, untenable against serious attack. While in 5th Shock Army, the 320th had crossed the river at Chebruchi, southeast of <a href="Tiraspol">Tiraspol</a>. Due to several reorganizations, the division was now in <a href="37th%20Rifle%20Corps">37th Rifle Corps</a> of <a href="46th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">46th Army</a> on May 12, holding a bridgehead between 1 - 2km deep and 3km wide in low-lying marshlands, with the Germans in possession of the high ground. Major General Ilia Shvygin had been in command of the 320th since July 30, 1943.

Before dawn on May 13, a powerful 50-minute artillery preparation struck Shvygin's defenses, followed by an attack by elements of German <a href="6th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">6th Army's</a> XXIX and XXX Army Corps. The division beat off the first reconnaissance-in-force, but after a further preparation the full assault began at 0700 hrs. 478th and 481st Rifle Regiments, in the front line, began to give ground grudgingly. The attackers worked through the boundary between the two regiments and reached the river, breaking the bridgehead into two segments. By 0800 hrs. the defenders found themselves literally with their backs to the river, with no room to maneuver and increasingly vulnerable to enemy fire. At 0930 hrs. the river crossing was destroyed, and the defenders were effectively encircled. During the next four hours, while defending heroically, the rifle regiments were destroyed, with only a few stragglers managing to swim the river. General Shvygin and most of his staff were killed while directing the defense. This event finally brought the Soviet offensive to a halt, and it would not be renewed until August, which in part gave time for the 320th to recover from its mauling.

The division would remain in 37th Rifle Corps until the last weeks of the war. From September to December, 1944, 46th Army was in <a href="2nd%20Ukrainian%20Front">2nd Ukrainian Front</a> near <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, before reverting to 3rd Ukrainian Front at year's end. In January, 1945, 37th Corps became a separate unit in the reserves of 2nd Ukrainian Front. The following month, in preparation for the final offensive on <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, the 320th and its corps became part of <a href="27th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">27th Army</a>, back in 3rd Ukrainian Front. In the last weeks of April the division was detached from 37th Corps to operate as a separate division under 27th Army.

By the conclusion of hostilities, the division had been awarded the full title of "320th Rifle, Yenakiyevo, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division"; (Russian: 320-я стрелковая Енакиевская Краснознамённая ордена Суворова дивизия). Initially part of the <a href="Southern%20Group%20of%20Forces">Southern Group of Forces</a> with the 37th Rifle Corps, the division and its corps became part of the <a href="38th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">38th Army</a> after 27th Army was disbanded in the <a href="Carpathian%20Military%20District">Carpathian Military District</a>. The division was moved to <a href="Kamenetz-Podolsk">Kamenetz-Podolsk</a> in the fall of 1945. The corps and the 320th Rifle Division were disbanded by July 1946.

Hilda Chester

Hilda Chester (September 1, 1897 – December 1, 1978), also known as Howlin' Hilda, was a <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> <a href="Fan%20%28person%29%23Sports">fan</a>, and arguably the most famous fan in baseball history.

Chester began her long allegiance to the Dodgers as a teenager, when she stood outside the offices of the <a href="Brooklyn%20Chronicle">Brooklyn Chronicle</a> every day to hear the scores of the Dodgers' games as soon as possible. After a while, she was able to get passes to games from sportswriters. At some time, she was hired as a peanut sacker by the <a href="Harry%20M.%20Stevens">Harry M. Stevens</a> corporation, which ran the concession stands at <a href="Ebbets%20Field">Ebbets Field</a> and most other <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> stadiums, breaking down 50 pound sacks of peanuts into retail bags for sale. After she was done with her work, she was able to watch the games. She also worked for the Stevens' concession at <a href="Aqueduct%20Racetrack">Aqueduct Racetrack</a>. Eventually, she "graduated" to selling hot dogs. By the 1930s, she was attending Dodgers' games frequently, and in , after <a href="Larry%20MacPhail">Larry MacPhail</a>, the Dodgers' executive vice president, instituted Ladies' Day at Ebbets Field with a ten cent admission price, she became a regular.

Because of her extremely loud voice, thick <a href="Brooklynese">Brooklynese</a> accent, and allegiance to the Dodgers, Chester was well-known in Ebbets Field and beyond, throughout Brooklyn. But she became famous after her first heart attack. Instructed by her doctor not to yell anymore, she returned to Ebbets Field with a frying pan and iron ladle, and made so much noise that everybody quickly knew who she was. The Dodgers' players soon replaced her noisemaking implements with a brass <a href="cowbell">cowbell</a> as a gift. She also received grandstand passes from the team, but preferred to sit in the <a href="bleachers">bleachers</a>. In , she had a second heart attack, and by then was important enough to be visited in by Dodgers' manager <a href="Leo%20Durocher">Leo Durocher</a> and several players.

On one occasion, Chester influenced the events of a game, and almost its outcome. With Dodgers' pitcher <a href="Whitlow%20Wyatt">Whitlow Wyatt</a> holding a big lead, Chester dropped a folded note onto the outfield grass and yelled to <a href="Pete%20Reiser">Pete Reiser</a>, "Give that to Leo!" Reiser picked up the paper, and at the end of the inning, ran in from the outfield, exchanging brief greetings with general manager <a href="Larry%20MacPhail">Larry MacPhail</a>, who was sitting next to the dugout. Reiser then gave the note to Durocher. It said that Wyatt was getting tired, and that <a href="Hugh%20Casey%20%28baseball%29">Hugh Casey</a> should start to warm up in the <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a>. When Wyatt gave up a hit in the next half-inning, Durocher promptly replaced him with Casey, who was then hit very hard. The Dodgers held on to win, but in the clubhouse afterward, Durocher was livid, yelling at Reiser, "Don't you ever give me another note from MacPhail as long as long as you play for me!" Reiser answered that the note wasn't from MacPhail, it was from Hilda. It was one of the few times Durocher was at a loss for words.

Chester also occasionally accompanied the Dodgers on short road trips. In <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, one of her counterparts for the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Phillies</a> started to yell at and berate <a href="Dixie%20Walker">Dixie Walker</a>, calling him a has-been. "You're all through!" yelled the Phillies' fan. Chester quieted him with one comment. "Oh, yeah?" she yelled back. "Look where he is, and look where you are!"

In 1943, Chester was given a silver bracelet from by the Dodgers, with her first name on the band, and a small dangling silver baseball.

In 1946, Chester was called as a defense witness for Durocher, who was on trial for assault. The previous year, a fan named John Christian had been heckling the Dodgers' players from the Ebbets Field grandstand many times over several weeks. On June 9, 1945, Durocher had enlisted Joseph Moore, a special policeman at the game, to get Christian from his seat, and the three met under the stands. Christian wound up with a broken jaw, and Durocher was accused of using brass knuckles to beat him up. Chester testified that Durocher had come to her aid and was defending her honor because Christian had been calling her names, including "cocksucker," and "usin’ langwidge that shocked the ladies." After two days of testimony from several witnesses, including Durocher, who testified in his own defense, the jury deliberated 38 minutes and both Durocher and Moore were acquitted on April 25, 1946.

Of all the Dodgers' players and managers, Chester was partial to Durocher because he had led the visit to the hospital when she had her heart attack in 1941. Durocher also sent her cards annually at Christmas time for many years. Chester also occasionally went to <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a> and the <a href="Polo%20Grounds">Polo Grounds</a>, and to <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> to see the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>, and although her initial allegiance was with the Dodgers, she became ambivalent between the Dodgers and the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> after Durocher became the Giants' manager.

Chester appeared on the episode of <a href="This%20is%20Your%20Life">This is Your Life</a> which celebrated the life of umpire <a href="Beans%20Reardon">Beans Reardon</a>, in the Ebbets Field scene of the comedy "<a href="Whistling%20in%20Brooklyn">Whistling in Brooklyn</a>", and in "Brooklyn, I Love You" (1946), a Paramount Pictures short highlighting the Dodgers’ 1946 season.

The Dodgers named their all-time team in between games of their <a href="Old-Timers%27%20Day">Old-Timers' Day</a> double-header in . On the occasion, they asked other significant contributors to the team who were in the stands to take bows, including <a href="Billy%20Herman">Billy Herman</a>, former star second baseman, Whit Wyatt, former star pitcher, <a href="Leon%20Cadore">Leon Cadore</a>, who pitched an entire 26 inning game in , <a href="Otto%20Miller">Otto Miller</a>, who was on the Dodgers' first two pennant-winning teams of the modern era, <a href="Artie%20Dede">Arthur Dede</a>, <a href="Gus%20Getz">Gus Getz</a>, <a href="Jack%20Doscher">Jack Doscher</a>, three of the oldest living Dodgers, and Hilda Chester as the Dodgers' all-time fan. Several weeks later, she was profiled in a newspaper article in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>.

After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles following the season, Chester said she "wouldn't be caught dead" going to see them in Philadelphia, their closest visit to Brooklyn.

When the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, Chester lost her team, her outlet to fandom, and her fame, although she continued to be a semi-celebrity for several more years. Upon the razing of Ebbets Field in , she and five members of the Dodger Sym-Phony band appeared on "Be Our Guest", a short-lived <a href="television">television</a> program on <a href="CBS">CBS</a>. (Other guests on that episode were former Dodgers <a href="Ralph%20Branca">Ralph Branca</a> and <a href="Carl%20Erskine">Carl Erskine</a>, and former "<a href="The%20Phil%20Silvers%20Show">Phil Silvers Show</a>" regulars <a href="Maurice%20Gosfield">Maurice Gosfield</a> and <a href="Harvey%20Lembeck">Harvey Lembeck</a>. She was also honored as "America’s No. 1 baseball fan" during ceremonies at the opening of the National Baseball Congress tournament in <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a> in .

However, over time, she slowly faded from the news, although she maintained some of her old ties to the Dodgers. In 1969, Dixie Walker noted that he hadn’t been back to Brooklyn "for years" although he added, "but last September I got a birthday card from Hilda Chester. She never misses a one."

Chester died on December 1, 1978. By then, she apparently was no longer in touch with or had no immediate family, and was indigent. She was buried by the <a href="Hebrew%20Free%20Burial%20Association">Hebrew Free Burial Association</a> in their <a href="Mount%20Richmond%20Cemetery">Mount Richmond Cemetery</a> on <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>. Unlike many of her antics, her death was not reported in any news media.

Three years after her death, Chester's character had a minor role in <a href="The%20First%20%28musical%29">"The First"</a>, the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical about <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> that was adapted from a book by <a href="Joel%20Siegel">Joel Siegel</a>, with music by <a href="Bob%20Brush">Bob Brush</a> and lyrics by <a href="Martin%20Charnin">Martin Charnin</a>. More than 30 years later, she was the subject of a one-person biographical musical, "Howling Hilda". She is also remembered by the annual <a href="Baseball%20Reliquary%23The%20Hilda%20Award">Hilda Award</a> given by the <a href="Baseball%20Reliquary">Baseball Reliquary</a>, and with a nearly life-size fabric-machê statue at the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>.

Paper currency grading

Paper currency grading is the process of determining the grade or condition of a <a href="bank%20note">bank note</a>, one of the key factors in determining its value. A banknotes grade is generally determined by crispness (Rigid not limp paper), brightness, and depth of color. Other factors that are taken into consideration include centering of the printed area, artificially suppressed folds, repairs, and pinholes. Certification services professionally grade banknotes for tiered fees.

<a href="United%20States%20banknote">United States banknotes</a> are graded by a system much like the 70 point <a href="Sheldon%20coin%20grading%20scale">Sheldon coin grading scale</a> which is used for coins.

38 Virginis b is an <a href="super-Jupiter">super-Jupiter</a> <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a> orbiting within the <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a> of the star <a href="38%20Virginis">38 Virginis</a> about 107 <a href="light-year">light-years</a> (32.7 <a href="parsec">parsecs</a>, or nearly <a href="km">km</a>) from Earth in the constellation <a href="Virgo%20%28constellation%29">Virgo</a>. The exoplanet was found by using the <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">radial velocity method</a>, from <a href="radial%20velocity">radial-velocity</a> measurements via observation of <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shifts</a> in the <a href="spectrum">spectrum</a> of the <a href="planet">planet's</a> parent star.

38 Virginis b is a <a href="super-Jupiter">super-Jupiter</a>, an exoplanet that has a radius and mass larger than that of the planet <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. It has a temperature of . It has a mass of 4.51 and a likely radius of around 1.05 based on its mass. 

The planet orbits a (<a href="Stellar%20classification%23Class%20F">F-type</a>) <a href="star">star</a> named <a href="38%20Virginis">38 Virginis</a>. The star has a mass of 1.18 and a radius of around 1.46 . It has a temperature of 6557 <a href="Kelvin">K</a> and is about 1.9 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is metal-rich, with a <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> ([Fe/H]) of 0.16, or 117% the solar amount. Its luminosity () is 3.48 times that of the Sun.

The star's <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 6.11. Therefore, 38 Virginis is on the edge of not being visible to the naked eye, but it can be clearly spotted with binoculars. 

38 Virginis b orbits its star every 825 days at a distance of 1.82 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a> (close to <a href="Mars">Mars</a>'s orbital distance from the Sun, which is 1.53 AU). It likely receives 3% more <a href="stellar%20flux">sunlight</a> as the Earth does from the Sun, due to its effective temperature being close to that of the Earth (in fact, only 3 degrees warmer).

38 Virginis b resides in the <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a> of the parent star. The exoplanet, with a mass of 4.51 , is too massive to likely be rocky, and because of this the planet itself may not be habitable. Hypothetically, large enough moons, with a sufficient atmosphere and pressure, may be able to support liquid water and potentially life. However, such moons do not usually form around planets, they would likely have to be captured from afar; e.g, a <a href="protoplanet">protoplanet</a> running astray.

For a stable orbit the ratio between the moon's <a href="orbital%20period">orbital period</a> "P" around its primary and that of the primary around its star "P" must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> that orbits 1 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> from a Sun-like star. In the case of 38 Virginis b, the orbital period would have to be no greater then 80 days (a little over 2 months) in order to have a stable orbit.

Tidal effects could also allow the moon to sustain <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, which would cause volcanic activity to regulate the moon's temperature and create a <a href="Dynamo%20theory">geodynamo effect</a> which would give the satellite a strong <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>.

To support an Earth-like atmosphere for about 4.6 billion years (the age of the Earth), the moon would have to have a Mars-like density and at least a mass of 0.07 . One way to decrease loss from <a href="sputtering">sputtering</a> is for the moon to have a strong <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> that can deflect <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> and radiation belts. NASA's <a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo's</a> measurements hints large moons can have magnetic fields; it found that <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s moon <a href="Ganymede%20%28moon%29">Ganymede</a> has its own magnetosphere, even though its mass is only 0.025 .

The search for 38 Virginis b started when its host star was chosen an ideal target for a planet search using the <a href="radial%20velocity%20method">radial velocity method</a> (in which the gravitational pull of a planet on its star is measured by observing the resulting <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a>), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">Doppler spectroscopy</a> measurements. It was also confirmed that 38 Virginis is neither a binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common <a href="false%20positive">false positives</a> when searching for transiting planets. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated the existence of a planet. The net result was an estimate of a 4.52 planetary companion orbiting the star at a distance of 1.82 AU with an eccentricity of 0.03.

The discovery of 38 Virginis b was reported in the online archive <a href="arXiv">arXiv</a> on August 29, 2016.

Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017

Latvia will participate in the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202017">Eurovision Song Contest 2017</a>. The Latvian broadcaster <a href="Latvijas%20Telev%C4%ABzija">Latvijas Televīzija</a> (LTV) will organise the national final "Supernova 2017" in order to select the Latvian entry for the 2017 contest in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Between 16 and 20 songs will be selected to compete in the national final, which will consist of four shows: two heats, one semi-final and a final. In the heats and the semi-final, four entries will be selected to advance from each show: two entries will be selected based on a public televote and two entries will be selected by a jury panel. Four songs will ultimately qualify to compete in the final on 26 February 2017 where a public vote will exclusively select the winner.

Prior to the 2017 Contest, Latvia had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest seventeen times since its first entry in 2000. Latvia won the contest once in <a href="Latvia%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202002">2002</a> with the song "<a href="I%20Wanna%20%28Marie%20N%20song%29">I Wanna</a>" performed by <a href="Marija%20Naumova">Marie N</a>. Following the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%23Qualification%20and%20semi-finals">introduction of semi-finals</a> for the , Latvia was able to qualify to compete in the final between 2005 and 2008. Between 2009 and 2014, the nation had failed to qualify to the final for six consecutive years. In the <a href="Latvia%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202015">2015 contest</a>, Latvia managed to qualify to the final with the song "<a href="Love%20Injected">Love Injected</a>" performed by <a href="Aminata%20Savadogo">Aminata</a>, which placed 6th in the final, scoring 186 points, giving them their best placing since <a href="Latvia%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202005">2005</a>. In <a href="Latvia%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202016">2016</a>, Latvia managed to qualify to the final and place 15th with the song "<a href="Heartbeat%20%28Justs%20song%29">Heartbeat</a>" performed by <a href="Justs%20Sirmais">Justs</a>.

The Latvian national broadcaster, <a href="Latvijas%20Telev%C4%ABzija">Latvijas Televīzija</a> (LTV), broadcasts the event within Latvia and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. Latvia has selected their entries for the Eurovision Song Contest through a national final. Since their debut in 2000 until 2012, LTV had organised the selection show "<a href="Eirodziesma">Eirodziesma</a>". In a response to the nation's failure to qualify to the final at Eurovision since 2008, between 2013 and 2014, the competition was rebranded and retooled as "Dziesma". However, after failing to produce successful entries those two years, LTV developed the "<a href="Supernova%20%28Latvian%20TV%20series%29">Supernova</a>" national final in order to select their 2015 entry. The competition produced two Latvian entries in 2015 and 2016 that managed to qualify the nation to the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2017, LTV announced that the "Supernova" format would return once again to select the Latvian entry.

"Supernova 2017" will be the third edition of <a href="Supernova%20%28Latvian%20TV%20series%29">Supernova</a>, the music competition that selects Latvia's entries for the Eurovision Song Contest. Competition producer Ilze Jansone stated that the goal of "Supernova", as in the previous two years, is to find a competitive song and artist with potential for international success. The competition will commence on 5 February 2017 and conclude with a final on 26 February 2017.

The format of the competition will consist of four shows: two heats, one semi-final and a final. The four shows will take place at LTV Studio 6 in <a href="Riga">Riga</a>. LTV will broadcast two introductory shows on 22 and 29 January 2017 that will cover the background preparation processes and performer auditions that occur prior to the competition. The competing entries will also be announced during the second introductory show on 29 January. The two heats, to be held on 5 and 12 February 2017, will each feature between eight and ten competing entries from which four will advance to the semi-final from each show. The semi-final, to be held on 19 February 2017, will feature the eight qualifiers from the heats from which the top four will proceed to the final. The final, to be held on 26 February 2017, will select the Latvian entry for Kiev from the remaining four entries.

Results during the heats and the semi-final shows will be determined by a jury panel and votes from the public. In the heats and the semi-final, the songs will first face a public vote where the top two entries will qualify. The jury will then select an additional two qualifiers from the remaining entries to proceed in the competition. In the final, a public vote will exclusively determine which entry will be the winner.

Artists and songwriters are able to submit their applications and song entries separately to the broadcaster between 17 August 2016 and 28 October 2016. Local and international jury panels will be appointed by LTV for the selection process. The international jury panel will evaluate the submitted songs between 28 October and 10 November 2016 and will only provide consultation on which entries should be selected; the local jury will make the ultimate decisions. The international jury panel will consist of Petri Mannonen (Commercial Director at <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group Finland</a>), Matthias Mueller (CEO of Crazy Planet Records), Fruzsina Szép (festival director of <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza Berlin</a>) and <a href="Joy%20Deb">Joy Deb</a> (songwriter, co-wrote the <a href="Sweden%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202015">2015 Swedish Eurovision</a> winning song "<a href="Heroes%20%28M%C3%A5ns%20Zelmerl%C3%B6w%20song%29">Heroes</a>"). The local jury will shortlist artists for auditions that will take place on 15 and 22 November 2016 at LTV Studio 6. The selected performers and songs will be determined by 12 December 2016 and all relevant parties will be informed. The competing artists and songs will be announced during the second introductory show that will be broadcast on 29 January 2017.

The "Eurovision Song Contest 2017" will take place at the <a href="International%20Exhibition%20Centre">International Exhibition Centre</a> in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and will consist of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and the final on 13 May 2017.

On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company <a href="EMC%20Corporation">EMC Corporation</a>. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history". The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016 

The announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business. It's thought that the company's value has roughly doubled since then.

After the merge of the original <a href="Dell">Dell Inc.</a> and <a href="EMC%20Corporation">EMC Corporation</a>, it was created into a new holding company named <a href="Dell%20Technologies">Dell Technologies</a>, with subsidiaries of the original Dell and EMC Corporation becoming subsidiaries of the new company.

<a href="Michael%20Dell">Michael Dell</a>, the founder of the Dell brand, said in an interview with <a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">Fortune</a> "we want to innovate on behalf of customers, and that is a challenge for many <a href="Publicly%20traded%20company">public companies</a>—particularly if they don't have the right portfolio.

The new subsidiary Dell will be the computer technology branch of <a href="Dell%20Technologies">Dell Technologies</a>, continuing its computer business from the original Dell Inc.

A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1984 video game)

A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is a <a href="side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a href="action-adventure">action-adventure</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> released for the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> in <a href="1984%20in%20video%20gaming">1984</a>. It was rereleased by <a href="CRL%20Group">CRL</a> in <a href="1985%20in%20video%20gaming">1985</a> under the title Journey.

The game has no real narrative; the introduction simply places the player in the role of an unnamed explorer, who must delve into a subterranean labyrinth to locate 11 hidden treasures and return them to the surface.

The game takes places in a massive, <a href="side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> underground maze, throughout which is hidden 11 treasures. The goal is to find all of the treasures and return them to the surface. At the beginning of the game, the player character can run, jump, and climb. However, the player can obtain items that will expand their abilities, most of which are required to beat the game. They include dynamite to blow open walls, umbrellas to protect against falling rocks, oxygen pills to breathe underwater, a gun to shoot enemies, and more. The player has only 8 inventory slots, and each item and treasure occupies one; furthermore, the player cannot jump when carrying 6 or more, and cannot climb when carrying 8. Consequently, the player must backtrack to the surface several times over the course of the game to unload their currently-held treasure. The player can also drop unneeded items at any time. Items can be selected with the number keys on the keyboard and are used with the joystick's fire button.

"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth" received mostly positive reviews from the magazines of the day. "<a href="C%26amp%3BVG">C&VG</a>" gave it 8/10 for graphics, 8/10 for sound, 7/10 for value, and 8/10 for playability. "<a href="Your%20Commodore">Your Commodore</a>" gave it 5/10 for originality, 5/10 for playability, 3/10 for graphics, and 3/10 for value-for-money, finding the controls difficult but nevertheless concluding, "I recommend this game to anyone who wants a few hours of fun". "Commodore Horizons" gave it 5/8 for graphics, 5/8 for sonics, and 6/8 for gameplay, calling it an "agreeable arcade adventure . . . Unremarkable graphically; but good fun to play"

SPAMasterpiece Theater

SPAMasterpiece Theater (or S.P.A.M. Theater) is an <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="web%20series">web series</a> starring humorist <a href="John%20Hodgman">John Hodgman</a> where he does dramatic readings of unsolicited <a href="email%20spam">email spam</a> received by "<a href="Boing%20Boing">Boing Boing</a>" editors in a parody of "<a href="Masterpiece%20%28TV%20series%29">Masterpiece Theatre</a>". The series featured images and videos from <a href="Creative%20Commons">Creative Commons</a>-licensed media.

In 2008, "S.P.A.M. Theater" debuted. Each episode features a dramatization of <a href="email%20spam">email spam</a>. Originally, the series featured images and videos from <a href="Creative%20Commons">Creative Commons</a>-licensed media from the <a href="image%20hosting%20service">image hosting</a> and <a href="video%20hosting%20service">video hosting</a> website <a href="Flickr">Flickr</a> and the nonprofit <a href="digital%20library">digital library</a> <a href="Internet%20Archive">Internet Archive</a>. The second episode "FOR MY DAUGHTER'S SAKE/DE@L OF A LIFETIME" featured the voices of Russ Gooberman and Dana Devonshire. In the third episode "Love Song of Kseniya," "<a href="Boing%20Boing">Boing Boing</a>"s <a href="Xeni%20Jardin">Xeni Jardin</a> reads her own email spam. In the fourth episode "The Proposition," Erik Sheppard of Voice Talent Productions contributes a voice.

In October 1, 2008, Jardin announced the official debut of the web series "SPAMasterpiece Theater"—almost a month before the American release of <a href="John%20Hodgman">John Hodgman</a>'s <a href="satire">satirical</a> <a href="almanac">almanac</a> "<a href="More%20Information%20Than%20You%20Require">More Information Than You Require</a>". Hodgman described it as "true tale[s] of romance, adventure, infamy, and low-cost prescription drugs, all culled from the reams of actual, unsolicited emails, received here by us and people like you -- what we call SPAM." The hosted series included dramatic readings by Hodgman in a parody of "<a href="Masterpiece%20%28TV%20series%29">Masterpiece Theatre</a>". In 2010, "<a href="Boing%20Boing%23Boing%20Boing%20TV">Boing Boing Video</a>"s Jardin was picked as "Curator of the Month". She commended the series with "These were so much fun to put together."

The first four "SPAMasterpiece Theater" episodes opened with a <a href="chiptune">chiptune</a> remix of <a href="Jean-Joseph%20Mouret">Jean-Joseph Mouret</a>'s "<a href="Fanfare-Rondeau">Rondeau: Fanfare</a>" (<a href="1735%20in%20music">1735</a>) by Hamhocks Buttermilk Johnson.

"<a href="PopSugar">PopSugar</a>"s <a href="Lee%20Pace">Lee Pace</a> called the first episode of "SPAMasterpiece Theater" "the best viral video of the week." "Vulture"s Matthew Perpetua praised the series with "Hodgman's deadpan delivery is typically excellent, but we're particularly fond of the deliberately pretentious juxtaposition of stock footage in the dramatizations. <a href="PBS">PBS</a> might want to look at this." In a retrospective celebrating the anniversary of "Boing Boing TV", "<a href="BBC%20Online">BBC Online</a>"s web producer Ellen West described "SPAMasterpiece Theater" as "It's like <a href="Adam%20Curtis">Adam Curtis</a> doing a nonsense <a href="The%20Power%20of%20Nightmares">Power of Nightmares</a>."

Domestic violence hotlines are generally available at all times during the day, however, problems with busy lines or disconnections due to lack of funding sometimes limit their usefulness. Additionally, battered gay men report that hotline workers will sometimes not provide them with services or will refer them to the batterers' line. Nonetheless, scholars assume that hotlines reduce frequency of domestic violence.

Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew is a scholarly book written by linguist <a href="Ghil%27ad%20Zuckermann">Ghil'ad Zuckermann</a>, published in 2003 by <a href="Palgrave%20Macmillan">Palgrave Macmillan</a>. The book consists of 304 pages, including an index. It was the first monograph published within the series "Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change". The book has two ISBNs: ISBN 978-1-4039-3869-5 and ISBN 1-4039-1723-X.

The cover of the book features three <a href="Israeli%20Hebrew">Israeli Hebrew</a> words, all finally-stressed:


The book proposes a socio-philological framework for the analysis of "camouflaged borrowing" such as <a href="phono-semantic%20matching">phono-semantic matching</a>. It introduces for the first time a classification for "multisourced <a href="neologism">neologisms</a>", new words that are based on two or more sources at the same time. The analysis presented in this book challenges <a href="Einar%20Haugen">Einar Haugen</a>'s classic typology of lexical borrowing. Whereas Haugen categorizes borrowing into either substitution or importation, this book explores cases of "simultaneous substitution and importation" in the form of camouflaged borrowing. Examples of such mechanisms are phonetic matching, semanticized phonetic matching, phono-semantic matching and <a href="Calque">calquing</a>.

The book provides new perspectives on <a href="word%20formation">word formation</a>, <a href="language%20change">language change</a> and <a href="language%20contact">contact linguistics</a>. It establishes a principled classification of neologisms, their semantic fields, the roles of source languages, and the attitudes of <a href="Linguistic%20purism">purists</a> and ordinary native speakers towards multi-factorial coinage. It analyses the tension between linguistic creativity and cultural flirting on the one hand, and the preservation of a distinct language identity on the other hand.

The book explores words and phrases in <a href="Israeli%20Hebrew">Israeli</a>, <a href="Turkish%20Language">Revolutionized Turkish</a>, <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a>, <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>, <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>, <a href="Estonian%20language">Estonian</a>, <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>, <a href="pidgin%20language">pidgins</a> and <a href="creole%20language">creoles</a>.

There is only paddy field and some chanel and low land is visible. Nowadays chhatrabhog is a small village but earlier it was located a larage area in the bank of Adiganga. According to Kalidas Dutta that from Jalghata to Kashinagar was the main part of Chhatrabhog.Local people says that there is a river named Chhatrabhog/Chutorbhog (Local pronounciation) used flow towards the west side of this area.The mouth of this river still now existed south of Roydighi B.Ed. College.This river Chutorbhog meets with River Mani at <a href="Kumarpara">Kumarpara</a>.

Shri Shri Chaitanya Dev Came and stayed one night at Chhatrabhog at the time of going to Orissa/Neelachal (Utkal) to seek Jagganath Dev. In <a href="Chaitanya%20Bhagavat">Chaitanya Bhagavat</a> we get a vivid description in the 2nd chapter of Antayleela.After reaching Chhatrabhog he went to <a href="Ambulinga-ghat">Ambulinga-ghat</a>. From Chaitanya bhagavat we get this line in Bengali version Chhatrabhog gela Prabhu Ambulinga-Ghate / Shatamukhi Ganga Dekhil nikate. Another reference of Chhatrabhog is "Ganga Shiv probhave se Chhatrabhog Gram/ hail param teertha Mahateertha Nam".Those lines indicates that it is a great Teerth sthan (Pilgrimage Centre). A mythological story we found in the Chaitanya Bhagavat of Vindaban Das. Description is Bhagirath was able to release and come down Ganga to earth from the hairball of Lord Shiva. After this incident days passed and Lord Shiva was very eager to meet further to Goddess Ganga.To seek goddess Ganga he came down to earth and at last met with her at this Chhatrabhog. Here Lord Shiva wanted to verify the devotion of Ganga to Him. He dived into the water of Ganga and remained and stayed as water form here. So Chhatrabhog is the union place of Lord shiva and Goddess Ganga.

Chandimangal of Mukundaram chakraborti was very familiar book in Bengali literature. His book is popular in the name of <a href="Kavikankan%20Chandi">Kavikankan Chandi</a>. in this book is composed in the last part of 16 th century. There in Dhanapati Saudagar Upakhayn (Sadhur Mogray Gamon) part we find Daine anek gram rakhe sadhubala/ Chhatrabhog arrail abosan bela/Tripura pujiya sadhu chalil sattwar/ Ambulingae giya uttaril saudagar/ Here we find Goddess of Tripura which is now worshipped here as the name of <a href="Tripura">Tripura</a>. In this village <a href="Maa%20Tripura%20temple">Maa Tripura temple</a> is still now remained. Original Description in Bengali,"ডাইনে অনেক গ্রাম রাখে সাধুবালা।/ছত্রভোগ এড়াইল অবসান বেলা।/ ত্রিপুরা পূজিয়া সাধু চলিলসত্বর।/অম্বুলিঙ্গে গিয়া উত্তরিল সদাগর॥/শ্রী নীলমাধব পূজা করেন তত্‍পর।/তাহার মেলানি সাধু পাইল হেতেঘর।" Neelmadhab was black stone idol of Lord of Vishnu.

Nel Law

Nelle Isabel Law, generally known as Nel Law, (1914–1990) was an Australian artist, poet and diarist. As the wife of the scientist and explorer <a href="Phillip%20Law">Phillip Law</a>, she was the first Australian women to set foot in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> when she travelled with her husband to the <a href="Mawson%20Station">Mawson Station</a> in 1960–61.

Law met her husband at <a href="Melbourne%20University">Melbourne University</a>. They were married for over 40 years but decided not to have children as her husband's career would make it difficult for him to be a good father. When Phil Law decided to take her to Antarctica, he had her smuggled onto the ship in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>. There were heated discussions before the ship set off but it was finally decided that if Nel Law was escorted off the ship, it would create too much negative publicity. In fact, quite the opposite occurred when she remained on board as this led to fantastic publicity for Phil and ANARE (<a href="Australian%20National%20Antarctic%20Research%20Expeditions">Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions</a>).

Law, a talented artist, produced a number of oils, water colours and sketches while she was at the base. She had been appointed to make graphic records by ANARE. She had accompanied her husband on the "Magga Dan". Her work developed from somewhat <a href="Expressionistic">Expressionistic</a> landscapes to far more abstract works, even when she was painting penguins. In 2005–06, a collection of her drawings was presented by the <a href="Tasmanian%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery</a> who also hold some of her paintings in their permanent collection. In 1965, Law founded the Antarctic Wives Association of Australia, later known as the Antarctic Family and Friends Association. She was the association's first president and later patron. Now part of the <a href="Australian_National_Antarctic_Research_Expeditions%23ANARE_Club">ANARE Club</a>, the association was intended to provide a social link and support for the wives of expeditioners.

The <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> holds a large collection of Law's works which include correspondence, news clippings, poems, sketches and diaries. Her diaries contain drafts of her "Breaking New Ice: Australia's First Woman To Visit Antarctica" which had been prepared for publication.

The Danish-built icebreaker <a href="MV%20Nella%20Dan">MV "Nella Dan"</a> which served Australia's Antarctic programme was name in her honour.

Nel Law died in June 1990. Her ashes, together with those of her husband Phillip, were interred near the <a href="Mawson%20Station">Mawson Station</a>, Antarctica, on 19 June 2011.

<doc id="51572572" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51572572" title="Photo-reflectance">
Photo-reflectance

Photo-reflectance is an <a href="optical">optical</a> technique for investigating the material and electronic properties of <a href="thin%20film">thin films</a>. Photo-reflectance measures the change in <a href="reflectance">reflectivity</a> of a sample in response to the application of an amplitude modulated <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">light</a> beam. In general, a photo-reflectometer consists of an intensity modulated "pump" light beam used to modulate the reflectivity of the sample, a second "probe" light beam used to measure the reflectance of the sample, an optical system for directing the pump and probe beams to the sample, and for directing the reflected probe light onto a <a href="photodetector">photodetector</a>, and a signal processor to record the differential reflectance. The pump light is typically modulated at a known frequency so that a <a href="lock-in%20amplifier">lock-in amplifier</a> may be used to suppress unwanted noise, resulting in the ability to detect reflectance changes at the ppm level.

The utility of photo-reflectance for characterization of <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> samples has been recognized since the late 1960s. In particular, 
conventional photo-reflectance is closely related to electro-reflectance in that the sample's internal electric field is modulated by the photo-injection of electron-hole pairs. The electro-reflectance response is sharply peaked near semiconductor interband transitions, which accounts for its usefulness in semiconductor characterization. Photo-reflectance spectroscopy has been used to determine <a href="electronic%20band%20structure">semiconductor bandstructures</a>, internal electric fields, and other material properties such as <a href="Crystalline">crystallinity</a>, <a href="Materials%20science">composition</a>, physical strain, and <a href="Doping%20%28semiconductor%29">doping concentration</a>.

The name "photo-reflectance" or "photoreflectance" is shortened from the term "photo-modulated reflectance," which describes the use of an intensity modulated light beam to perturb the reflectance of a sample. The technique has also been referred to as "modulated photo-reflectance," "modulated optical reflectance," and "photo-modulated optical reflectance." It has been known at least since 1967.

Photo-reflectance is a particularly convenient type of modulation <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a>, as it may be performed at room temperature and only requires the sample have a reflecting surface. It is an established tool for non-contact determination of material and electronic properties of semiconductor films. In photo-reflectance, a pump laser beam is used to modulate the free charge density in a semiconductor sample (via photo-injection), thereby modulating one or more physical quantities (e.g. the internal electric field). The measured signal ΔR is the change in amplitude of the reflected probe light as the intensity modulated pump radiation interacts with the sample. The normalized signal is ΔR/R, i.e. the pump-induced change in reflectance (AC) divided by the baseline reflectance (DC). The conventional photo-reflectance apparatus uses a spectroscopic source for the probe beam, such that the signal may be recorded as a function of the probe light's wavelength. Generally, the signal may be written:
where ΔR/R is the normalized change in reflectance, "α" (≡1/R×∂R/∂ε) and "β" (≡1/R×∂R/∂ε) are the "Seraphin coefficients" which contain filmstack information, and Δε and Δε are the pump induced changes in the complex <a href="dielectric%20function">dielectric function</a>. However, in conventional photo-reflectance analysis, it is not necessary to independently determine the refractive and absorptive components (the first and second terms in ΔR/R, respectively) of the signal. Rather, a fit to the overall signal is performed using the third derivative functional form given by <a href="David%20E.%20Aspnes">Aspnes</a>. This fit procedure yields the interband transition energies, amplitudes, and widths. However, because the signal depends on the uniformity of the perturbation, the extraction of such parameters must be treated with care.

The conventional photo-reflectance experimental setup uses a xenon or tungsten based lamp source passed through a <a href="monochromator">monochromator</a> to form the incident probe beam. The pump beam may be formed by a the output of a continuous wave (CW) laser (e.g. a <a href="helium%20neon%20laser">He-Ne</a> or He-Cd laser) passed though a chopper wheel, or may be formed by the output of a directly modulated <a href="laser%20diode">semiconductor diode laser</a>. The pump beam is focused to a spot on the sample where it interacts with the sample. The probe beam is co-focused onto the sample where it is reflected. The reflected probe beam is collected and passed through an <a href="optical%20filter">optical filter</a> to eliminate any unwanted pump light and/or <a href="photoluminescence">photoluminescence</a> signal. Thereafter the probe beam is directed onto a photodetector (e.g. a Si or InGaAs <a href="photodiode">photodiode</a>), which converts the probe intensity to an electrical signal. The electrical signal is processed to eliminate unwanted noise, typically using a <a href="phase%20locked%20loop">lock-in circuit</a> referenced to the modulation frequency. The photo-reflectance signal is then recorded as a function of probe beam wavelength using a computer or the like.

In photo-reflectance, the sample's internal electric field is modulated by the photo-injection of electron-hole pairs (thus reducing the latent field). In order to achieve photo-injection, the energy of photons in the pump beam must exceed the <a href="band%20gap">band gap</a> of material within the sample. Furthermore, semiconductors with little or no electric field will exhibit little or no electro-reflectance response. While this situation is not common, this point makes clear the importance of maintaining the probe intensity at a minimum, since any photo-injection of electron-hole pairs from the probe will necessarily offset the sample baseline condition by reducing the latent field. (Likewise, any CW component of the pump is undesirable.) Conversely, if the probe intensity is too low, detection may not be possible with conventional photodiodes. A further consideration is that phase-locked detection is a practical necessity due to the small size of the experimental signals (~ppm) and the unique ability of phase-locked detection methods to reject noise outside a narrow bandwidth centered on the modulation frequency.

Photo-reflectance is a highly sensitive measurement technique and provides unmatched capability for characterizing the material and electronic properties of thin films. Photo-reflectance has been particularly important in basic research on semiconductors due to its ability to precisely determine semiconductor bandstructures (even at room temperature). As an optical technique, photo-reflectance would appear suited to industrial applications because it is non-contact, and because it has good spatial resolution. However, the need for spectroscopic information limits measurement speed, and consequently the adoption of spectroscopic photo-reflectance in industrial applications such as process control of <a href="microelectronics">microelectronics</a> manufacturing.

Nevertheless, where spectroscopic information is not required, photo-reflectance techniques have been implemented in semiconductor manufacturing process control. For example, in the late 1980s, Therma-Wave, Inc. introduced the "Therma-Probe" photo-modulated reflectance system to the market for semiconductor process control equipment. The original Therma-Probe focused an intensity modulated pump laser beam onto a spot on a silicon sample, modulating the sample reflectance. The reflectance changes were detected by a coincident laser probe beam of 633 nanometer wavelength. At this wavelength no electro-reflectance signal is present, since it is far removed from any interband transitions in silicon. Rather, the mechanisms responsible for the Therma-Probe signal are thermo-modulation and the Drude free carrier effect. The Therma-Probe was used primarily for monitoring of the <a href="ion%20implantation">ion implantation</a> process in silicon semiconductor manufacturing. Measurement systems such as the Therma-Probe are particularly desirable in process control of microelectronics manufacturing because they provide the ability to quickly verify the correct execution of process steps, without contacting the wafer or removing the wafer from the clean room. Generally a number of measurements will be made on certain areas of the wafer and compared with expected values. As long as the measured values are within a certain range, the wafers are passed for continued processing. (This is known as <a href="statistical%20process%20control">statistical process control</a>.) Other photo-modulated reflectance systems marketed for process control of implant processes are the "TWIN" metrology system marketed by <a href="http%3A//www.pvatepla.com/en/home">PVA TePla AG</a>, and the "PMR-3000" marketed by <a href="https%3A//www.semilab.hu/">Semilab Co. Ltd</a> (originally Boxer-Cross, Inc.).

However, by the mid 2000s, new manufacturing processes were requiring new process control capabilities, for example the need for control of new "diffusion-less" <a href="Rapid%20thermal%20processing">annealing processes</a> and advanced <a href="strained%20silicon">strained silicon</a> processes. To address these new process control requirements, in 2007, <a href="http%3A//www.xitronixcorp.com/index.html">Xitronix Corporation</a> introduced a photo-reflectance system to the semiconductor process control market. Like the Therma-Probe, the Xitronix metrology system utilizes a fixed wavelength probe beam generated by a laser. However, the probe beam of the Xitronix system has a wavelength of approximately 375 nanometers, near the first major interband transition in silicon. At this wavelength the electro-modulation signal is dominant, which enabled the Xitronix system to precisely measure active doping concentration in diffusion-less annealing processes. This probe beam wavelength also provided excellent sensitivity to strain in strained silicon processes.

Spectroscopic photo-reflectance employs a broad band probe <a href="light%20source">light source</a>, which may cover wavelengths from the <a href="infrared">infrared</a> to the <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>. By fitting spectroscopic photo-reflectance data with the conventional third derivative functional form, a comprehensive set of interband transition energies, amplitudes, and widths may be obtained, providing an essentially complete characterization of the electronic properties of the sample of interest. However, owing to the need to keep the probe light intensity to a minimum and to the practical necessity of phase-locked detection, spectroscopic photo-reflectance measurements must be made sequentially, i.e. probe one wavelength at a time. 
This constraint limits the speed of spectroscopic photo-reflectance measurements, and coupled with the need for a careful fit procedure, renders spectroscopic photo-reflectance more suitable for analytical applications. Conversely, laser photo-reflectance employs a <a href="monochromatic">monochromatic</a> light source, and hence is well suited for industrial applications. Moreover, in commonly encountered situations, the coherent wavefront of laser probe beam may be used to isolate the refractive component of the photo-reflectance signal, greatly simplifying the data analysis. This approach implements the unique capabilities of photo-reflectance to characterize the electronic properties of thin films in a platform suitable for industrial applications.

The Calypso bean, or orca bean, yin yang bean, is a bean <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> of the species "<a href="Phaseolus%20vulgaris">Phaseolus vulgaris</a>".

Calypso Beans are a kidney bean hybrid. They grow on a bush-type bean plant that grows up to 15 inches (38 cm) tall. There will be 4 to 5 beans per pod. 70 to 90 days from seed for harvest. The beans are small, 3/8 inch (1 cm) long, but plump. 

Calypso beans are the best known as distinctly colored variety with a striking contrast of black and white in color. The beans are half black, half white, with one or two black dots in the white area though there is also a red and white variety.

When young, the pods can be harvested as a green bean. But when full-grown, they are used as a bean for drying.

Calypso Beans double in size when cooked, and have a smooth texture: 1 cup dried beans = 2 cups cooked beans.

Moscow Central Circle

The Moscow Central Circle or MCC (, МЦК), designated Line 14 or just Encircle Line () and marked in a strawberry red/white color is a <a href="Urban%20rail%20transit">urban-metro railway</a> orbital line that encircles historical <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>. Built from 2013 till 2016 and opened to passengers on 10 September 2016, the line officially follows the <a href="Little%20Ring%20of%20the%20Moscow%20Railway">Little Ring of the Moscow Railway</a> and is operated by the <a href="Moscow%20Government">Moscow Government</a> owned company MKZD through the <a href="Moscow%20Metro">Moscow Metro</a>, with the <a href="Government%20of%20Russia">Federal Government</a>-owned <a href="Russian%20Railways">Russian Railways</a> selected as the operation subcontractor. The track infrastructure and most platforms are owned by Russian Railways, while most station buildings are owned by MKZD.

The railroad was commissioned in 1897 under the auspices of Czar <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a>, thus earning a "Royal Railroad" nickname. The planning took five years. Thirteen design alternatives were reviewed in the process. The winning bid was for a four-track rail line, with two tracks allocated for freight, and the other two used by passenger trains. The project came with an estimated 40 million <a href="Russian%20ruble">ruble</a> price tag.

In May 1902, construction began. Following a defeat in the 1905 <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, construction was scaled back. As the costs overran the estimate by a third, the number of tracks being built was reduced to two. Bridges, of which there are 35 (4 big and 31 small), were particularly costly. Their low clearance hindered electrification efforts for over a century to come. The vast railroad infrastructure included housing facilities, water towers, smithies, and miscellaneous shops. Station houses — architectural masterpieces built in the typical early-20th-century Russian industrial style — had electricity. Heat was provided by <a href="Masonry_heater">masonry heaters</a>, some of which were <a href="Russian_oven">Russian-made</a>, and some imported from Holland. Station clocks were purchased from Swiss manufacturer . Known for their accuracy, these clocks, for a while, became the city's de-facto time standard. Only one such clock has survived. It is located in Presnya station supervisor's office.

The first train ran in 1907. On July 19, 1908, the railroad officially opened. The opening ceremony was attended by the Czar, Royal Dynasty members, and government and city officials.

In the first few months, the railroad was used exclusively for passenger traffic. Due to a high train fare — at 3.40 rubles — ridership was virtually non-existent, and the line brought in the total of 132 rubles in revenue since the operation started. Thus, on October 10, 1908, passenger trains were discontinued in favor of freight service.

Between <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> of 1917, the passenger service was restored, although freight remained the only viable revenue source. By the late 1920s, other forms of public transportation had emerged, and, in 1934, passenger service was ended, only to resume, again, 82 years later.

Around 2010, utilized the city's subway system daily. Some 35-40% used private transportation, leading to severe road congestion.

Upgrade plans for the railway line were signed by <a href="Russian%20Railways">Russian Railways</a> and the <a href="Moscow%20Government">Moscow Government</a> between 2008 to 2011 with consent of <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> (<a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Russia">Prime Minister</a> at the time). Construction work planned for 2013–2016 would convert the Little Ring line of the Moscow Railway for joint passenger and freight use but in 2012, at a meeting with new Prime Minister <a href="Dmitry%20Medvedev">Dmitry Medvedev</a> in <a href="Odintsovo">Odintsovo</a>, Moscow Mayor <a href="Sergey%20Sobyanin">Sergey Sobyanin</a> acknowledged that trains on the circle railway would not be fully ready until 2020. The required work included:

Construction commenced in 2012, and passenger services began in the third quarter of 2016. During the reconstruction of the railway, many of the original passenger stations were re-purposed for passenger use and complemented with new stations.

The line opened on September 10, 2016 in the presence of President Vladimir Putin and Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin. The line is free to ride for the first month of operation. By the end of 2016, the daily ridership on the Central Circle Line is expected to be reach 400,000 and by 2025, the ring railway is expected to carry up to 300 million passengers annually.

The operation of the Central Circle is similar to the <a href="S-Train">S-Train</a> systems in Germany and other countries. Ticketing on the Moscow Central Circle is fully integrated with the Moscow Metro; the same payment cards (such as the <a href="Troika%20card">Troika card</a>) can be used on both systems, and free transfers will be possible within 90 minutes since the first entry into the system, in a way similar to the transfers between the Metro proper and the <a href="Moscow%20Monorail">Moscow Monorail</a>. The line serves the purpose of a connector between the different radial lines of outer Moscow, much as the <a href="Koltsevaya%20Line">Koltsevaya Line</a> does in inner Moscow. According to Moscow's deputy mayor, 130 trains per day will circulate around the circle line, with a frequency of 5–6 minutes during the rush hours, and 10–15 minutes at other times. The line's hours of operation will be the same as the rest of the Metro, from 06:00 until 01:00.

Despite its name, the Moscow Central Circle is not circle-shaped. The line stretches outward in the northwest and draws as close as to the Kremlin in the south. The Metro's <a href="Third%20Interchange%20Contour">Third Interchange Contour</a> (an extension of <a href="Kakhovskaya%20Line">Line 11/Kakhovskaya Line</a>), which is under construction and will also be a circle line, will reach further to the south.

An estimated 1,500,000 people lived near the line in the early 21st century.

The Central Circle Line has 26 opened stations, with 5 further stations still under construction to be opened by late 2016 There are 5 direct transfers to other Moscow Metro lines and 9 more free transfers available within walking distance from MCC stations.

The line is operated by 33 <a href="Lastochka">Siemens ES2G "Lastochka"</a> trains and Podmoskovnaya depot. Andronovka, Lihobory and Presnya <a href="Little%20Ring%20of%20the%20Moscow%20Railway">MK MZD</a> yards also serves as depots.

Djamilya Abdullaeva

Djamilya Abdullaeva (Джамиля Абдуллаева,) is a model, singer and actress. She gained fame and vast popularity after her debut on the <a href="Global%20Talk%20Show">Global Talk Show</a> (aka "Misuda" or "Chat with Beauties"), on the <a href="Korean%20Broadcasting%20System">Korean Broadcasting System</a> (KBS) as a member of the panel in November, 2007. She has also released a catchy music track by the name of "Oppa Mih-O", translated as "I Hate You, Oppa", in 2008. She began acting in 2012 and starred in the CGV <a href="Korean%20drama">television drama</a> series, "Sexy Mong Returns". She has been one of the top models for the <a href="shopping%20channel">Home Shopping Network</a>.

Abdullaeva was born on December 14, 1984 in <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>. As a young girl, Abdullaeva often played Dress-Up with her sister, flaunting her modeling and role-playing skills early on, only to realise later that she always had the talent and passion for this art. She always had the support of her liberal-minded family that encouraged her to fulfill her aspirations. At the age of 16, she went with a friend to the <a href="Hyundai%20Department%20Store%20Group">Miss Hyundai</a> modeling contest, and she casually decided to participate in it. She walked the ramp unprepared, with hundreds of professional models and to her incredulity, she won her first competition, bagging several accolades for her natural charm and beauty. She received several offers for other modeling projects following the win, but her mother wanted her to finish her schooling. So for 2 years, she pursued her education. She was later contacted by an international modeling agency, offering her an assignment which led her to eventually move to South Korea at the age of 18 to become a professional model.

At the young age of 19, Abdullaeva suffered the loss of her father, and regretfully, she could not make it to his funeral. She paid this unfortunate price and further dedicated herself to her work in the following years.

Abdullaeva once visited France during a festival, where she was approached by 2 Korean tourists who requested to take a picture with her, and upon leaving, they gifted her the "God of love". She took this as a sign that she was destined to be in Korea.

Upon moving to South Korea, she took up the project of modeling for an online shopping platform as a fitting model for women's clothing apparel. She was also offered a contract to model for the <a href="Hyundai%20Department%20Store%20Group">Hyundai</a> <a href="shopping%20channel">Home Shopping Network</a>, which is one of the 3 biggest <a href="department%20store">department store</a> chains in South Korea. She had soon become a beloved face on channels as one of the top models on the home shopping platform.

Soon, several modeling projects started pouring in. She was invited as a special guest to walk the ramp for the Corcaroli and Tulip fashion show for KBS in 2007. She did a "Sexy Queen" themed photo shoot for Star Hwabo in Malaysia (스타화보) in 2008, where she wowed the camera with her sex appeal and stunning looks.

In 2008, Abdullaeva represented PaeWang (패왕, "Legend of a Warrior"), the Korean arcade game, as its brand ambassador.

She made an appearance at the <a href="2008%20Korea%20Professional%20Baseball%20season">2008 Baseball Samsung PAVV</a>, <a href="SK%20Wyverns">SK Wyverns</a> versus <a href="KIA%20Tigers">KIA Tigers</a> game, throwing out the first ball at the <a href="Incheon%20Munhak%20Stadium">Incheon Munhak Stadium</a>. Abdullaeva also played a celebrity exhibition match with <a href="Jeanette%20Lee%20%28pool%20player%29">Jeanette Lee</a> at the XTM Billiards Championship during the 2nd Annual Showdown in 2008.

As her popularity grew among the masses, Abdullaeva decided to insure her voice. A friend advised her to get her beauty insured instead, against unforeseeable career threatening accidents. She took this advice to prevent harm to her exceptionally natural good looks, and got insured with an internationally recognised hospital in South Korea.

In 2012, Abdullaeva did a photo shoot as the main model for the "Bubble Bra" brand, where she was praised for her sensuous grace. The Bubble Bra became a popular product for its comfortable fit, unique strapless design, and invisible look that enhances any piece of clothing. Following this, she also displayed her luscious curves in a shoot for the 'S' shaped underwear line, the same year. She paraded her sizzling bikini body for the <a href="California">California</a> Beach Race World Advertising Shoot for their <a href="TV%20Commercial">TV Commercial</a>.

She has traveled to Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, China and Indonesia for modeling contracts signed with reputed modeling agencies.

Abdullaeva received wide acclaim and stardom following her TV debut on the <a href="Global%20Talk%20Show">Global Talk Show</a> ("Misuda", KBS2) in 2007. The show consists of a panel of young foreign women, residing in South Korea, who share their experiences in Korea, and the discussion topics follow their diverse cultural backgrounds in a talk show format. She attended classes at a university to get a grip on the Korean language for the show. With help from friends, she became proficient in conversational level Korean within the short span of a month. The show also features some talent performances whereby, the international panelists showcase their acting, singing and dancing skills. In one such segment, she performed with the beloved girl group and band, <a href="Wonder%20Girls">Wonder Girls</a> on the song, "Tell Me", and became an overnight country sensation. She was ranked 2nd on the list of top internet searches and news on the web portal, <a href="Naver">Naver</a>, following her performance on the show, which gained the interest of several viewers across the country.

Abdullaeva joined acting school to brush up her skills, while managing a hectic schedule of interviews, concerts, talk shows and theater rehearsals. Her focus never shifted from vocals, dancing, acting and modeling.

She was cast in the main role of a detective in <a href="https%3A//search.naver.com/search.naver%3Fwhere%3Dnexearch%26amp%3Bsm%3Dtab_etc%26amp%3Bie%3Dutf8%26amp%3Bos%3D661900%26amp%3Bpkid%3D57%26amp%3Bquery%3D%25EC%2583%2589%25EC%258B%259C%25EB%25AA%25BD%25EB%25A6%25AC%25ED%2584%25B4%25EC%25A6%2588">"Sexy Mong Returns"</a>, a CGV season drama series on cable TV, in 2008.

Later in 2008, Abdullaeva attracted the attention of several viewers for her role on the reality show, "Legally Blonde - Dongsangyimong," where she was cast alongside two other models, Jenny and Tatiana. 3 male models were cast opposite these foreign women and the show focused on the comedy that arises out of cultural conflicts between couples.

Abdullaeva played a minor role on the sitcom drama <a href="Unstoppable%20Marriage%20%28TV%20series%29">Unstoppable Marriage</a> on KBS, in 2008. She also performed a Cha cha cha dance routine on <a href="Dancing%20with%20the%20Stars%20%28South%20Korean%20TV%20series%29">"Dancing with the Stars"</a>, a dance competition show, in 2009 on KBS.

Post this, she spent a short period of time in Dubai and later returned to Korean TV in 2012. She appeared on "Joo Byung Jin Talk Concert" (주병진 토크 콘서트, MBC) as a main panelist, following which, she made an appearance on the popular healing talk show, "Yeo Yoo Man Man" (여유만만, KBS2). She also appeared on the variety show, "<a href="Happy%20Together">Happy Together</a>" which is one of the most watched shows on Korean television.

When asked about her stay in Dubai, she disclosed that she had set up a company there in 2012, where she held the position of the CEO, which is what had kept her busy.

Abdullaeva had confessed on the Global Talk Show about her aspiration to become a singer. The channel was pleasantly surprised to hear of this talent and they offered to record a track with her, to be released as a digital single.

She released her debut single "Oppa Mih-O" (오빠미워) (translated as "I Hate You, Oppa"), accompanied by a music video, in 2008. She is the first foreign singer who sings in Korean in South Korea. For this track, she extensively studied the Korean language in order to pronounce the lyrics more naturally and to gain fluency in the language. Her song, "Oppa Mih-O" is inspired by "Amore Mio", a song by the <a href="Croatian">Croatian</a> band, Karma. Her song is listed on the karaoke menus of renowned hotels across the world as a part of popular Korean music.

Abdullaeva had confessed being an admirer of the South Korean actor, <a href="Kwon%20Sang-woo">Kwon Sang-woo</a> on the <a href="Global%20Talk%20Show">Global Talk Show</a>. She got to meet him soon enough, at the invitation of the actor, during the shooting of the TV Series, <a href="Bad%20Love">Bad Love</a> for the KBS Network. She was thrilled to meet him and did not conceal her happiness and affection for the actor, posting several pictures on her blog. Internet surfers flooded her blog and the meet drew a lot of media attention. The meet was also broadcast on the show later.

In an online poll taken in 2008, 35.9% out of a whopping 219610 netizens voted for Abdullaeva as the 'Queen of Coquetry'. She topped the list as the 'Best Female Star' and was undoubtedly the most charming of all. The report stated that Djamilya's coquetry is unmatched and incomparable.

National Political Union (England)

The National Political Union (England) was an organisation set up in October 1831, after the rejection of the <a href="Great%20Reform%20Act">Reform Bill</a> by the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, to serve as a <a href="pressure%20group">pressure group</a> for parliamentary reform: “to support the King and his ministers against a small faction in accomplishing their great measure of Parliamentary Reform”.

Modelled by <a href="Francis%20Place">Francis Place</a> on the influential <a href="Birmingham%20Political%20Union">Birmingham Political Union</a>, (but without its emphasis on currency reform) the N. P. U. was meant to serve both as a co-ordinating body for the country's political unions, and as a particular outlet for London radicals.

The N. P. U. was involved in controversy from its very outset, when the constituting meeting was invaded by a working-class protest against its middle-class membership: agreement on a moderate policy, but with half the Council seats reserved for manual workers, meant that the body would continue thereafter as a moderate centre of focus for both the middle and working classes of London. A month later, a government ban on umbrella organisations effectively put paid to the N. P. U.'s hopes of replacing the Birmingham Political Union as a nation-wide co-ordinating body; and in the New Year it found itself divided again on the question of whether to urge the government onwards with reform, or simply express support for the Whig ministry, as its President, <a href="Sir%20Francis%20Burdett%2C%205th%20Baronet">Sir Francis Burdett</a>, preferred.

It was only after the dismissal of the Whig ministers, when the so-called <a href="Days%20of%20May">Days of May</a> protests against the forming of a Tory administration began, that the N. P. U. came into its own, with a major influx of members, and of finance. A series of co-ordinated measures – a petition to the Commons for the withholding of the budget; public meetings against reaction; and an organised run on the Bank of England's gold - helped provide that “pressure from without” to which <a href="Charles%20Grey%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Grey">Earl Grey</a> attributed much of the eventual success of the Whig Bill.

Thereafter however, after a brief attempt by the N. P. U. to organise support for liberal candidates at the 1832 election, a collapse in both membership and finances took place, its very success leading to the undoing of the essentially single-issue body.

Newcastle state by-election, 1917

The Newcastle state by-election, 1917 was a <a href="by-election">by-election</a> held on 12 May 1917 for the <a href="South%20Australia">South Australian</a> <a href="South%20Australian%20House%20of%20Assembly">House of Assembly</a> seat of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Newcastle%20%28South%20Australia%29">Newcastle</a>.

The by-election was triggered by the resignation of first-term Labor MP <a href="Thomas%20Butterfield">Thomas Butterfield</a> on 21 March to contest a seat in the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Australian Senate</a> at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201917">1917 federal election</a>. There were only two candidates: <a href="Port%20Augusta%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Augusta</a> labourer William Harvey for the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor Party</a>, and <a href="Quorn%2C%20South%20Australia">Quorn</a> farmer and grazier <a href="Edward%20Twopeny">Edward Twopeny</a> for the <a href="Liberal%20Union%20%28South%20Australia%29">Liberal Union</a>. Twopeny, who had unsuccessfully contested the seat twice previously, won the seat.

The election saw a drastic drop in turnout, which was down more than 25% from the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201915">1915 state election</a>. This was attributed by both candidates to major problems with the electoral roll. Twopeny criticised the "disgraceful state of the electoral roll", stating that the rolls "could not be in a worse condition" and expressing concern about voters being disenfranchised for being "too late" to be counted, while others who were present on the roll were dead or had left the state. He hoped there would soon be "clean rolls". Harvey stated that "had the rolls been in good order Labor would have won" and claimed that 200 Labor voters in Port Augusta had been refused a vote, but stated he was "pleased with the way Mr Twopeny had run the campaign". "<a href="South%20Australian%20Register">The Register</a>" in Adelaide reported that there had been "great indignation" about the state of the rolls, with voters who "had their cards and transfer notices" not being on the certified roll. The newspaper also noted that the time at which the polls closed and the location of the polling booth in Port Augusta differed from that at the Commonwealth elections one week prior.

Butterworth lost the Senate race at the federal election, reclaimed his Newcastle seat at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201918">1918 state election</a> and would go on to be a senior minister in state Labor governments during the 1920s.

Flag of Trenton, Georgia

The Flag of Trenton is used as the city flag of <a href="Trenton%2C%20Georgia">Trenton, Georgia</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It was adopted in 2001 partially as a protest following the change of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Georgia%20%28U.S.%20State%29">state flag of Georgia</a>. The flag is controversial because it incorporates the <a href="Confederate%20Flag">Confederate Flag</a>.

In 1956, the state of Georgia changed their flag to largely feature the Confederate battle flag as part of a protest against desegregation. In 2001, the <a href="Georgia%20General%20Assembly">Georgia General Assembly</a> voted to change the flag, relegating the placement of the Confederate flag to a greatly reduced place on the state flag. The city of Trenton opposed this new flag. In the same year, the <a href="City%20commission%20government">city's commissioners</a> voted to adopt the former state flag as the city's flag as a protest as well as voting in favour of displaying <a href="The%20Ten%20Commandments">The Ten Commandments</a> on the city hall, which became official in 2002. Previously the State of Georgia had stated that they would withdraw funding for any municipality that refused to fly the new state flag and continued to fly the old one. Trenton circumvented this when they adopted the flag by altering the former state flag by adding "City of Trenton" and "Incorporated 1854" to it. They also flew the new Georgia state flag and the <a href="flag%20of%20the%20United%20States">flag of the United States</a> along with the city flag in keeping with the state regulations.

The change was not universally supported and in 2004 the new mayor of Trenton, Anthony Emanuel removed it. However following objections from the <a href="Sons%20of%20Confederate%20Veterans">Sons of Confederate Veterans</a> that the flag represented their heritage, a referendum was held in 2005 with the city's residents voting 278-64 to keep the city flag.

<a href="Tyrone%20Brooks">Tyrone Brooks</a>, the Georgia representative who was behind the drive to change Georgia's state flag, criticized Trenton for readopting the old flag stating "I thought it was a terrible mistake for them to do that. I thought it was a terrible blow to the image of their community." One Trenton resident stated "We want people here, we want people to come visit us, and not something that says you know what we like things the way they are and we are not willing to change."

For his debut extended play "<a href="My%20World%20%28EP%29">My World</a>" (2009), he released music videos for the singles "<a href="One%20Time%20%28song%29">One Time</a>", "<a href="One%20Less%20Lonely%20Girl">One Less Lonely Girl</a>", and "<a href="Love%20Me%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20song%29">Love Me</a>". In the first two, Bieber portrays a young man trying to show his affection for a young girl. He is first disappointed by the outcome at the end of the video in "One Time", but then he earns a date at the end of the video in "One Less Lonely Girl". The "Love Me" music video is a combined compilation of footage from concerts, backstage, and studio filmed. 

Bieber then released his debut studio album and considered the second part of "My World", "<a href="My%20World%202.0">My World 2.0</a>" (2010), which released the music video for the single "<a href="Baby%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20song%29">Baby</a> featuring <a href="Ludacris">Ludacris</a> which became the second video to receive 1 billion views on YouTube, and is the fifteenth most viewed video on the site, with over 1.44 billion views as of August 2016. Despite this, the video has many more dislikes than it has likes. Although the song has received over 5.0 million likes, the song has received over 6.7 million dislikes. Both albums were featured in Bieber's first concert film "" which become the highest grossing music concert movie in the United States since 1984 and the third-highest grossing documentary since 1982. 

Bieber's second studio album and first <a href="Christmas%20music">Christmas album</a> "<a href="Under%20the%20Mistletoe">Under the Mistletoe</a>" (2011) released the music video for the singles "<a href="Mistletoe%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20song%29">Mistletoe</a>", "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town", "<a href="All%20I%20Want%20for%20Christmas%20Is%20You">All I Want for Christmas Is You (SuperFestive!)</a>", and "Fa La La" with the latter two featuring <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a> and <a href="Boyz%20II%20Men">Boyz II Men</a> respectively. 

In 2012, Bieber released his third studio album "<a href="Believe%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20album%29">Believe</a>", with "<a href="Boyfriend%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20song%29">Boyfriend</a>" as its lead single, whose music video features Bieber as more mature and with a new style. Upon release, the video broke the VEVO record for having the most views in a 24-hour period with 8.00 million. This album also was featured in Bieber's second concert film "<a href="Justin%20Bieber%27s%20Believe">Justin Bieber's Believe</a>", which did not have as much success as his first.

In 2015, the fourth studio album "<a href="Purpose%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20album%29">Purpose</a>" was released by Bieber. This album saw the release of the single "<a href="Where%20Are%20%C3%9C%20Now">Where Are Ü Now</a>", featuring <a href="Jack%20%C3%9C">Jack Ü</a>, and the release of the music video, which received four nominations at the <a href="2015%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2015 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, winning the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Visual%20Effects">Best Visual Effects</a> category.

It owned and operated <a href="Bankside%20Power%20Station">Bankside power station</a> on the south bank of the river Thames. The company provided and stimulated demand for electricity, increased its generating capacity, and competed and co-operated with other electricity undertakings in London. The company was dissolved on 1 April 1948 when the British electricity industry was nationalised.

In 1889 the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Corporation">Corporation of London</a> invited tenders from electrical plant manufacturers to provide electric lighting throughout the 1.25 square miles of <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. The Laing, Wharton and Down Construction Syndicate Limited undertook to supply the eastern district of the City and the Anglo-American Brush Electrical Engineering Company Limited to supply the central and western districts. Provisional Orders were obtained under the Electric Lighting Act 1888; these enabled any company or person to supply electricity and to install a system of supply. The Laing syndicate built a power station in the City at Wool Quay between the Custom House and the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> and the Brush company a power station at Meredith Wharf on <a href="Bankside">Bankside</a> on the south bank of <a href="River%20Thames">the Thames</a>. The Wool Quay site had little space for expansion and the generating station was closed in 1893, the equipment was sold or transferred to Bankside. The two contractors obtained consent from the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> to transfer their contracts to a new company formed on 5 February 1891 called the City of London (Pioneer) Electric Lighting Company with a capital of £50,000. Supplies of <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> electricity for street lamps in <a href="Queen%20Victoria%20Street%2C%20London">Queen Victoria Street</a> commenced from Bankside power station on 25 June 1891.

The City of London Electric Lighting Company Limited (CLELCo) was formed on 11 July 1891 with a capital of £800,000. The assets of the City of London (Pioneer) Electric Lighting Company were transferred to the new company for £95,000, the company also purchased the Provisional Orders of the Laing syndicate and the Brush company.

The company’s legal powers were the City of London Orders 1890 and 1891; the Southwark Order 1891; the City of London Electric Lighting Act 1893; the City of London Electric Lighting Act 1900; the London Electric Supply Act 1908; and the London Electricity (No.1) Act 1925. 

The company’s head office from 1896-1923 was at 1&2 Great Winchester Street, London EC2 and at Falcon House, <a href="Aldersgate">Aldersgate Street</a>, London EC1 from 1924-48. The electricity generation station was at 64 Bankside, London SE1. In the late 1930s the CLELCo had a showroom at 33 <a href="Ludgate%20Hill">Ludgate Hill</a> London EC4.

The first <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> supply for private consumers commenced on 14 December 1891 from Bankside power station. Between December 1891 and July 1892, 271 miles of electricity mains had been laid in the city, causing considerable disruption. By the mid-1890s demand for electric lighting in the City was increasing by about 1,000 additional electric lamps per week. The sub-station at St Benet Fink, for example, supplied the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Exchange%2C%20London">Royal Exchange</a> and the banks in <a href="Lombard%20Street%2C%20London">Lombard Street</a>. In October 1894 there were 13,000 lamps connected to this sub-station, by October 1896 there were 22,500, an increase of about 5,000 per year or doubling every three years. In 1896 the company had 5,303 customers as well as public lighting including thirteen miles of streets within the City. By the end of 1899 the company were supplying 430,000 <a href="Incandescent%20light%20bulb">incandescent lamps</a> plus 540 <a href="Arc%20lamp">arc lamps</a> for street lighting.

In addition the company rented out a range of electrical appliances including kettles, saucepans, irons and hotplates. An electric oven could be hired for between 7 to 12 shillings per quarter (£1=20 shillings), normally retailing at £7 to £14. In 1894 the company charged 4d. per unit (1 <a href="Kilowatt%20hour">kWh</a>) for electricity for cooking, half of the standard change of 8d. per unit (£1=240d.). The company had a scheme of free installation of wiring and fittings for a moderate rental charge.

Sales of electricity more than doubled in the nine years between 1904 (14 <a href="Kilowatt%20hour">GWh</a>) and 1913 (29 <a href="Kilowatt%20hour">GWh</a>). The average price the company charged from electricity fell from 7.56 d./kWh in 1895, to 4.09 d./kWh in 1900, 2.75 d./kWh in 1905, and 2.27 d./kWh in 1915. Electricity demand remained constant during the <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> but increased again over the following two decades. In 1937 the CLELCo’s street lighting supply was the cheapest in London at 0.633 d./kWh and its private electricity supply (1.735 d./kWh) was the third lowest in the capital; the private supply of the South Metropolitan Company was 1.294 d./kWh and the <a href="London%20Power%20Company">London Power Company</a> charged 1.676 d./kWh.

<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> had a significant impact on the company. On the night of 29/30 December 1940 Bankside lost some of its ancillary plant from 'Blitz' bombing, but the main generating plant was undamaged. By the morning the destruction of buildings in the City was such that 40 per cent of the company’s connected load had disappeared. It was estimated that the premises of 2,500 consumers had been destroyed and the cost to the CLELCo in lost revenue was estimated at about £100,000 per annum. The years 1942-44 were the only ones when the company did not pay its <a href="Shareholder">shareholders</a> a seven per cent dividend. 

The CLELCo's <a href="Revenue">net revenue</a> (revenue from supply of electricity less operating costs) over the period 1892-1916 was as follows: 

The CLELCo's revenue from sales of electricity, its working costs and the net revenue over the period 1917-1946 was as follows:
Until 1899 the company had a monopoly of electricy supply to the City of London. A Board of Trade inquiry into competition in 1899 resulted in a provisional order being granted to the Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation to supply electricity in competition with the CLELCo. The City of London Electric Lighting Act 1900 authorised the construction of a generating station at Bow.

The <a href="Electricity%20%28Supply%29%20Act%201919">Electricity (Supply) Act 1919</a> permitted undertakings to exchange electricity supplies, to work together or amalgamate. The CLELCo and three companies in south and east London - the County of London Electric Supply Company Limited; the South London Electric Supply Corporation Limited; and the South Metropolitan Electric Light and Power Company Limited - promoted the London Electricity (No.1) Act 1925. A joint committee was established to direct the way in which the generating stations of each company were operated. The companies remained distinct electricity generation and supply undertakings, but were physically connected with interconnecting cables to exchange electricity.

In 1923 Bankside power station, rated at 64 MW, had the largest generating capacity of any of the electricity companies or municipal undertakings in the London area. The County of London Company had a generating capacity of 39.7 MW; it commissioned the first 100 MW of its <a href="Barking%20Power%20Station">Barking ‘A’ power station</a> in 1925, this increased to 200 MW by 1930. The 1919 Act established the principle of equal consideration for the interests of shareholders and consumers of each company. Dividends to shareholders were limited to seven per cent per annum and the amount carried forward in the accounts was also restricted. Profits over and above these conditions formed a ‘consumers’ benefit’ in the form of lower prices. Two-thirds of the consumer’s benefit was to consumers and one sixth each for the company’s employees and for the shareholders.
Electricity grid interconnections in the 1930s, stimulated by the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, supported the further commercial integration of the ‘No.1 group’. In 1937 a quadripartite agreement was made between members of the group. The agreement “in the interests of consumers of electricity” was to establish a joint committee; to institute a common commercial procedure; to unify methods of charging consumers; and to avoid duplication and conflicting systems of supply mains involving unnecessary expenditure. The agreement envisaged the establishment of joint showroom premises to promote the use of electricity. In the late 1930s the CLELCo had a showroom at 33 <a href="Ludgate%20Hill">Ludgate Hill</a> in the City of London.

The company continued to sell electricity to other undertakings, and in the mid-1930s was supplying most of the electricity to north <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>. In the financial year 1931/32 the CLELCo supplied 2.17 GWh to Southwark Metropolitan Council, by 1936 this had increased to 13.92 GWh or about 9.5 per cent of the electricity generated at Bankside. The company continued to promote the use of electricity. In May 1938 it took over the management of the <a href="Finsbury">Finsbury</a> and <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> areas of the County of London Company. The CLELCo undertook to provide free wiring to the Peabody Buildings in <a href="Finsbury">Finsbury</a> and <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> but on condition that all gas lighting was removed. It estimated that the cost of providing electricity for 1,263 flats would be £10,000 but that revenue from lighting alone would be £3,000 per annum and more if tenants used electricity for cooking and heating. This scheme was a joint venture between the CLELCo and the County of London Electric Supply Company.

The CLELCo expanded its site on Bankside to provided for new generating equipment; from the mid-1890s until the late-1930s the company purchased and acquired surrounding properties and land. 

In 1897 the company purchased and demolished a row of shops and residential properties on the north side of Sumner Street <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a> adjacent to Bankside power station. This enabled the company to build an extension to the engine house bringing the building line to Sumner Street. 

In 1900 the company obtained an <a href="Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Act of Parliament</a> to compulsorily purchase surrounding properties and to divert local roads such as Pike Gardens. Some protection of working class housing was provided for in the Act: the company were obliged to erect “artizan’s or workmen’s dwelling-houses” sufficient for 200 people within St Saviour’s district of Southwark. The company also bought adjacent local properties as they came onto the market: in 1904 the company paid £600 for the freehold of the property at No.15, 16 & 17 Noah’s Ark Alley adjacent to the power station.

The company raised further capital by issuing 400,000 additional £1 shares in 1931, by this time there were about 4,000 shareholders. In the late-1930s the opportunity arose to purchase two large plots of land adjacent to Bankside power station. In December 1936, the <a href="Central%20Electricity%20Board">Central Electricity Board</a> (CEB) directed the company to purchase land owned by the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Corporation">City of London Corporation</a> to the east of Bankside. This amounted to 44,900 square feet (0.417 ha) at a price of £34,520. The site was of interest to the CEB for a possible extension of Bankside power station, not only to meet the electricity load of the CLELCo but also to provide electricity for other parts of London. The CEB proposed a 180 MW generating station on the extended site. In June 1938 the opportunity arose to purchase 79,000 square feet (0.734 ha) of land immediately to the west of Bankside power station. This land had belonged to the <a href="George%20Livesey">South Metropolitan Gas Company</a>. The additional land would enable the construction of a larger 250 MW power station on the site. The CEB directed the company to purchase the land at a price not exceeding £120,000. The auction took place on 23 June 1938, and the manager of the CLELCo wrote to the <a href="Electricity%20Commissioners">Electricity Commissioners</a> saying that he had been able to purchase the land for £45,000 “which is considerably less than my advisers and I expected to pay”. The company drew up plans, and ordered equipment, for a new 240 MW power station eventually built as <a href="Bankside%20Power%20Station">Bankside 'B'</a>. 

The company opposed the Government's <a href="Nationalization">nationalisation</a> of the British electricity industry. Representatives of the industry met with the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Power%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Minister of Fuel and Power</a> in December 1945 to discuss the implications of nationalisation. A company board meeting in January 1946 noted that “the London Companies should combine to oppose the Government’s nationalization proposals”. As a result of the <a href="Electricity%20Act%201947">Electricity Act 1947</a> on 1 April 1948 most of the private and municipal electricity undertakings and statutory bodies including the CLELCo and the CEB were dissolved. Ownership of all public supply power stations and the national grid was vested in the <a href="British%20Electricity%20Authority">British Electricity Authority</a>. The <a href="London%20Electricity%20Board">London Electricity Board</a> became the owners of the local distribution system and the local showrooms as well as being the face of the electricity industry for consumers in London. 

The CLELCo's articles provided for a minimum of three and a maximum of ten directors. The original financial qualification was £1,000, and their fee was £3,000 per annum. The fee was increased to £4,000 in 1923 and to £5,000 in 1930. Between 1934 and 1948 the qualification was 1,000 shares and the fees were £5,000 per annum.

Ziehm's best-known film is <a href="Flesh%20Gordon">Flesh Gordon</a>, a 1974 soft sex spoof of the <a href="Flash%20Gordon">Flash Gordon</a> serials. It was nominated for a <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for "Best Dramatic Presentation" in 1975 and is now celebrated as a cult classic. The film is also notable for providing the training grounds for several now-famous special effects artists like <a href="Rick%20Baker">Rick Baker</a>, <a href="Dennis%20Muren">Dennis Muren</a> and <a href="Greg%20Jein">Greg Jein</a>; animator <a href="Jim%20Danforth">Jim Danforth</a> also worked on the movie.

Ziehm grew up in a strict Lutheran family as the oldest of five siblings. He went to highschool in Monterey, California, before enrolling at MIT to study engineering and mathematics. He dropped out of college before graduation, however.

In 1961, he moved to Berkeley and opened a folk music club called The Cabale in September 1962. He encountered marijuana and even tried his hand at smuggling drugs, hitchhiked across North America and enjoyed the sexual revolution of the 1960s. He lost his co-ownership of The Cabale and moved to Los Angeles in 1967, where he briefly worked as a carpenter and started a rock band.

He met a business-savvy young man named <a href="Bill%20Osco">Bill Osco</a>, who became the manager of Ziehm's short-lived band. Osco wanted to get involved with the movie business, so he and Ziehm founded Graffiti Productions and started making <a href="porn%20loop">porn loops</a>. Ziehm would direct and shoot the films, Osco would produce and sell them. Since pornography, despite still being illegal, was quickly becoming an in-demand product, Graffiti was successful enough not only to become a sought-after supplier of films, but also to start producing longer, more ambitious films.

After two feature films ("What Happened to Stud Flame?" and "Virgin Runaway"), Graffiti made <a href="Mona%20the%20Virgin%20Nymph">Mona: The Virgin Nymph</a>, which became the first pornographic 35mm feature film to be nationally released in regular theaters and helped start the "<a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Porn">porno chic</a>" of the 1970s. Ziehm co-directed the film with Michael Benveniste and served as its director of photography. The film had no credits because the filmmakers didn't want to draw attention to themselves, and since Osco was the one travelling around and selling the movie to theaters, he was sometimes thought of as the director or sole creator of Graffiti's films.

Ziehm and Osco quickly followed up with several other films, including <a href="Harlot%20%281971%20film%29">Harlot</a>, "City of Sin" and "Seeds of Lust". Ziehm often credited himself as "Harry Hopper". He would later on use a variety of other names such as "Lynn Metz", "Linus Gator" or "Hans Johnson".

In 1972, Graffiti wanted to produce a more ambitious film: a porn parody of the old <a href="Flash%20Gordon">Flash Gordon</a> serials called <a href="Flesh%20Gordon">Flesh Gordon</a>. The production was plagued by numerous problems, including a police raid where all the negatives were confiscated, and the budget quickly ballooned from $25,000 to a reported $700,000. During the making of the film, Ziehm had a falling-out with Osco over financial issues, and became the sole owner of Graffiti. Osco would later go on and produce <a href="Alice%20in%20Wonderland%20%281976%20film%29">Alice in Wonderland</a>, a sex musical version of the <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a> tale.

While <a href="Flesh%20Gordon">Flesh Gordon</a> was successful, Ziehm did not want to move into regular, i.e. non-pornographic film work. He struck up a partnership with producer Peter Locke and made six more adult feature films from 1976 to 1981: "Sexteen", "Honey Pie", "Sweet Cakes", "Hot Cookies", "Star Virgin" and "Naughty Network". By then, video had replaced film in the production of adult movies, and since Ziehm was not interested in competing with decreasing budgets, he retired from filmmaking - even though he appeared as a performer in <a href="Suze%20Randall">Suze Randall</a>'s 1984 film "Miss Passion".

In 1989, Ziehm returned to the director's chair one more time for a sequel to <a href="Flesh%20Gordon">Flesh Gordon</a> called <a href="Flesh%20Gordon%20Meets%20the%20Cosmic%20Cheerleaders">Flesh Gordon Meets the Cosmic Cheerleaders</a>. The film failed to perform at the box office, and Ziehm retired for good.

After making his last adult feature film "Naughty Network" in 1981, Ziehm began to focus on other endeavors, including a series of vocabulary training audio cassettes called "Wordbank" and "Wordbuilders".

In the 90's, Ziehm edited two books of historic cartoons. The first, "Golf in the Comic Strips", was released in 1997. It collected golf-related cartoons from 1897 to 1995 and featured a foreword by <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>. Two years later, a collection called "Lawyers in the Comic Strips" followed.

In 2015, Ziehm published his memoirs, Take Your Shame and Shove It: My Wild Journey Through the Mysterious Sexual Cosmos. The book was first released as an ebook, a paperback followed in early 2016.

In June 2016, Ziehm started a website called <a href="http%3A//www.howardziehm.com">howardziehm.com</a>. The site includes his personal blog "ShameBusters" where he attacks prudery and prejudices.

Battle of Kokoda

The Battle of Kokoda consisted of two engagements fought in late July – early August 1942. Forming part of the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a> of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the battle involved military forces from Australia, supported by the United States, fighting against Japanese troops from Major General <a href="Tomitaro%20Horii">Tomitaro Horii</a>'s <a href="South%20Seas%20Detachment">South Seas Detachment</a> who had landed around <a href="Buna%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buna</a> and <a href="Gona">Gona</a> in <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> mid-July 1942, with the intent of capturing <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> to the south via the overland route. 

The first engagement took place on 28–29 July 1942, and saw a <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>-sized element of Australians attempt to hold the village from the advanced elements of the Japanese landing force, which were advancing towards the entrance to the Owen Stanleys. In a short firefight, the Australian company was almost encircled before withdrawing. The second engagement took place just over a week later between 8 and 10 August, during which a weakened Australian <a href="battalion">battalion</a> launched an attack from Deniki, aimed at re-taking Kokoda. At the same time, the main Japanese force also launched an attack and the two sides clashed head on along the track. Meanwhile, flanking attacks caught the Japanese force, which had also grown to around battalion strength, by surprise, and the Australians briefly took Kokoda and nearby Pirivi before being forced to withdraw to Deniki, which was the scene of further fighting prior to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Isurava">Battle of Isurava</a>.

As the Kokoda Track campaign continued, the Japanese pushed the Australians back towards Port Moresby, penetrating as far as Imita Ridge, until late September and early October, when the situation reversed and the Australians went on the offensive. As the Japanese withdrew north to assume defensive operations to consolidate their beachheads on the northern coast, the Australians subsequently re-took Kokoda in early November 1942.

On 21 July 1942, Japanese forces landed on the northern Papuan coast at Basbua, between <a href="Buna%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buna</a> and <a href="Gona%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Gona</a>, as part of a plan to capture the strategically important town of <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> via an overland advance across the <a href="Owen%20Stanley%20Range">Owen Stanley Range</a> along the <a href="Kokoda%20Track">Kokoda Track</a>, following the failure of a seaborne assault during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> in May 1942 and further losses during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. The advanced landing forces, consisting primarily of the Colonel Yosuke Yokoyama's 15th Independent Engineer Regiment, sailed from <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> and came ashore unchallenged as there were only a small number of Australians stationed in the area, and shortly afterwards a small advanced element, supported by elements of the 1st Battalion, <a href="144th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">144th Infantry Regiment</a>, began moving south-west towards Oivi, mounted in motor vehicles and on bicycles. These troops were initially tasked with proving the route over the Owen Stanleys before the main body of the landing force, Major General <a href="Tomitaro%20Horii">Tomitaro Horii</a>'s <a href="South%20Seas%20Detachment">South Seas Detachment</a>, arrived.

Following the landing, several minor skirmishes took place between the advanced elements of the Japanese landing force – Yokoyama Force – and small groups of Australian and Papuan forces primarily from the <a href="Papuan%20Infantry%20Battalion">Papuan Infantry Battalion</a> (PIB) around Awala and Giruwa. Brushing these aside, the Japanese began advancing steadily towards their objective on the southern coast. Meanwhile, the Australians, who had deployed only limited forces north of Port Moresby attempted to delay the Japanese along the track long enough to bring reinforcements forward. In this vane, a bridge at Wairopi was destroyed by the withdrawing PIB troops who had been reinforced by a platoon of Australians from the <a href="39th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">39th Infantry Battalion</a>, with a brief fire-fight on 24 July, before the Japanese began forcing a crossing of the <a href="Kumusi%20River">Kumusi River</a> in rubber assault boats supported by mortars and machine gun fire. 

The following day, a force of around 100 Australians and Papuans ambushed the Japanese around Gorari, killing two Japanese and wounding 13 more before withdrawing towards the higher ground. As the Australians and Papuans began massing in some numbers, with several plane loads being landed at Kokoda on 26 July and moving north, they attempted a stand around Oivi under Captain Sam Templeton, commander of 'B' Company, 39th Infantry Battalion. Encircled, and having suffered heavy losses – including Templeton who was captured and executed – the surviving Australians and Papuans withdrew to Deniki under the command of Watson, and guided south around the Japanese on the track by Lance Corporal Sanopa of the PIB. At Deniki, they linked up with reinforcements from the 39th Infantry Battalion that were preparing to move forward to Kokoda, with the intent of holding the village and its logistically important airfield. 

Positioned on a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range to the south of the Mambare River which runs roughly north-west to south-east, Kokoda lies around the northern approach to Port Moresby. Further to the south, the track rose steeply towards Deniki, where it entered the Owen Stanleys. Bounded to the east by Eora Creek – flowing roughly south from the Mambare – and beyond that the village of Pirivi, in 1942, the village's airfield which lay to the west offered both the Japanese and the Australians an important logistical hub into which supplies and reinforcements could be flown with which to prosecute the fighting in the mountainous area to the south or the flat country to the north.

The first engagement at Kokoda took place after skirmishes around Awala, Gorari Creek and Oivi, which had seen the Australians and Papuans of <a href="Maroubra%20Force">Maroubra Force</a> fall back towards Deniki, south of Kokoda. On 28 July, a force of around 130 to 140 Australians from the 39th Infantry Battalion – mainly survivors from the fighting around Oivi – as well as elements of the PIB and <a href="Royal%20Papua%20New%20Guinea%20Constabulary">Royal Papuan Constabulary</a>, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel <a href="William%20T.%20Owen">William T. Owen</a>, marched north from Deniki and re-occupied Kokoda village, after receiving information from an advanced party that the Japanese pursuing the survivors from Oivi had not yet reached the village. Flanked by parallel tracks which cut back south of the airstrip, Kokoda was not easily defendable, particularly by a company-sized element. Nevertheless, Owen positioned his force north of the village on the eastern tip of a "tongue-shaped plateau" that ran to the north-east of the airstrip. The Australians were set down in a horseshoe shaped defensive line, with three platoons forward and one back amongst the rubber trees guarding the Deniki track. From there, the Australians subsequently attempted to hold Kokoda village from an assault by around 200 Japanese from advanced elements of the <a href="144th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">144th Infantry Regiment</a> under Captain Tetsuo Ogawa. 

Stretched out across a wide front, the Australian stand was short-lived. Throughout the afternoon of 28 July, Ogawa's troops – mostly veterans of the fighting in China – advanced along the Kokoda–Oivi road, approaching Kokoda from the east before moving towards the flanks of the Australian position. During the afternoon, two US transport aircraft arrived overhead, carrying reinforcements from the <a href="49th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">49th Infantry Battalion</a> which were being brought up from Seven Mile Strip in Port Moresby, but the aircraft did not land as the defenders were slow in removing the barricades that had been placed across the airstrip and the pilots believed the situation too risky to land. As night fell, the Japanese began harassing the defenders before launching a frontal assault up the slope towards the plateau in the early hours of 29 July, supported by mortars and a 70 mm artillery piece. 

The artillery and mortars began inflicting casualties on Australians, who had nothing with which to counter the indirect fires ranging in on them. Nevertheless, they fought back with machine fire and rolled grenades down to slope towards the attacking Japanese. After about an hour of close quarters fighting, including hand-to-hand combat, the engagement ended in the Australians withdrawing from the village after Owen died from wounds received while moving amongst his troops to buoy their morale as the threat of encirclement grew. With indirect fire now along their withdrawal route, the Australians fell back under the cover of a thick fog and were subsequently led back to Deniki under the command of Major William Watson of the PIB, with the majority arriving around sunrise on 29 July. 

Australian losses amounted to seven killed and six wounded while 12 Japanese were killed and 26 were wounded in the assault. Japanese casualties included Ogawa, who was killed in the final stages of the fighting by the small Australian rearguard. For his actions during the engagement, Owen was posthumously bestowed the US <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, becoming the first Australian to receive this decoration. In withdrawing from Kokoda, the Australians had carried what equipment they could, but had left behind a large number of grenades, five machine guns and 1,850 rounds of rifle ammunition. The Japanese troops, who were issued with inferior grenades that had to be struck on the ground to prime, relished the find.

A brief lull in the fighting along the track followed before the second engagement around Kokoda took place over the period 8 to 10 August 1942. In the wake of the first engagement, both the Japanese and Australians had paused to bring up reinforcements. After sending the surviving members of 'B' Company back to Eora Creek, Lieutenant Colonel Allan Cameron – the brigade major of the <a href="30th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">30th Brigade</a> – took command of the 39th Infantry Battalion and advanced from Deniki on 8 August with around 430 men, intent on recapturing Kokoda in order to re-open the airfield. At the same time, the Japanese force, which had grown to around 660 men with the arrival of the remainder of Hatsuo Tsukamoto's 1st Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment and supporting elements, began their advance on Deniki.

The two sides subsequently clashed along the main Kokoda Track around Pitoki, near Faiwani Creek, in an <a href="encounter%20battle">encounter battle</a>. A see-sawing action followed over the next couple of days, in which the main Australian force, consisting largely of Captain Arthur Dean's 'C' Company, was pushed back along the track to the battalion's headquarters around Deniki. Dean was amongst those killed in the fighting and as the pursuers followed 'C' Company back to Deniki, Cameron hastily organised the defence of his headquarters, which had to fight off an attack over several hours. Elsewhere, 'D' Company, under Captain Maxwell Bidstrup, took Pirivi to the east of Eora Creek, thus placing pressure on the Japanese rear, while another Australian company – Captain Noel Symington's 'A' Company – retook Kokoda, finding it practically undefended. 

These gains caught the Japanese by surprise, but they quickly regained their composure and began counter-attacking. Two groups of engineers attacked the Australian company around Pirivi from east and west along the Kokoda–Oivi road, while Tsukamoto detached a company of infantry from the main body of the 1st Battalion, 144th Infantry to attack the company at Kokoda. The company that had attacked Pirivi subsequently withdrew back to via Komondo village carrying their wounded with them, arriving at Deniki in two groups on 9 and 10 August. Meanwhile, Symington's company, which had occupied Kokoda, held it against several determined attacks. In an effort to make the main Australian force aware that they had taken the village, Symington fired off a red signal flare, and dispatched messengers to go back to Cameron to advise him to send reinforcements and supplies. As the fighting around Kokoda intensified, the Australians continued to hold out, but efforts to reinforce them by air were frustrated by a refusal by the pilots to land at the besieged airfield. Finally, running low on ammunition and food, and having not received the promised aerial resupply, Symington's company was forced to withdraw west of Kokoda at 7:00 pm on 10 August, crossing Madi Creek south of the airstrip by means of a precipitous wire bridge before falling back south through the scrub. They subsequently re-crossed to the eastern side of Madi Creek before halting on the western side of Faiwani Creek, before moving on to the village of Naro where they were met by a small patrol which led them to Isurava, which they reached on 13 August.

Casualties during the second engagement amounted to 21 Japanese killed and 44 wounded, while the Australians experienced similar losses with 23 killed and 17 wounded. The circuitous route that 'A' Company had to take to withdraw from Kokoda meant that it was subsequently unavailable for the fighting that followed around Deniki in the days that followed, as it was ordered to withdraw to Eora village to rest. It was replaced by fresh, but inexperienced troops from 'E' Company – formed from the battalion's machine gun company – who were ordered to move up to Deniki from Isurava. Ironically, the day after the engagement Allied aircraft, unaware that the village had fallen due to communications delays, arrived over Kokoda dropping the supplies that Symington's company had been expecting. These fell into Japanese hands, alleviating some of their supply problems. Several hours later, Allied aircraft returned to bomb the village after news of its capture reached the Allied high command.

While not ultimately successful in holding Kokoda, the attack by Cameron's force had the effect of surprising the Japanese commanders and subsequently delayed the advance on Deniki by four days. In the wake of the action, the Japanese estimated that the Australian force holding Kokoda had numbered around 1,000, to 1,200, and the Japanese subsequently decided to delay the advance on Port Moresby until the main body of Major General Tomitaro Horii's South Seas Detachment arrived in mid-August. This delay ultimately bought the Australians time to bring up reinforcements. The loss of Kokoda deprived the Australians of a forward airfield for resupply and movement of troops. Had it been held, the Australians potentially would have been able to fly in reinforcements and supplies, which may have proved decisive in preventing the Japanese from advancing into the mountains around Deniki. As it was, the Japanese were prevented from taking advantage of the Kokoda airfield due to heavy aircraft losses during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Battle of Guadalcanal</a>. 

Nevertheless, the campaign continued with the Japanese advancing steadily south along the Kokoda Track. The two sides clashed again around Deniki between 13 and 14 August, during which the Australians were able to concentrate three companies from the 39th Infantry Battalion – 'C', 'D' and the newly arrived 'E' Company – across the track. Amidst a torrential downpour, Tsukamoto's troops launched a frontal attack, concentrating on the Australian left flank where the inexperienced 'E' Company under Captain William Merritt, was located, while scouts moved around the flanks of the Australian position. Heavy fighting followed, but by mid-morning on 14 August, the Australians were nearly encircled and Cameron gave the order to break contact and withdraw by platoons. This was completed in good order, but a large amount of supplies and personal belongings were abandoned. 

As veteran <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> formations including Brigadier <a href="Arnold%20Potts">Arnold Potts</a>' <a href="21st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">21st Brigade</a> arrived from Australia to reinforce Maroubra Force, the first major action of the campaign took place around <a href="Battle%20of%20Isurava">Isurava</a>. This was followed by actions around <a href="Battle%20of%20Eora%20Creek%20%26amp%3Bndash%3B%20Templeton%27s%20Crossing">Templeton's Crossing</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Mission%20Ridge%20%26amp%3Bndash%3B%20Brigade%20Hill">Efogi</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Ioribaiwa">Ioribaiwa</a> as the Japanese penetrated as far south as Imita Ridge, which was only a short distance from Port Moresby. In late September and early October, after reverses around <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> and Guadalcanal, the Japanese went onto the defensive as the strategic situation in the Pacific began to turn against them, and the Australians were able to launch a cautious counter-attack which saw them retake Kokoda unopposed on 2 November 1942. Finding the airstrip in a state of disrepair, the Australians began efforts to reopen the airstrip. As supplies began to arrive, the logistical burden of trekking supplies up the track was alleviated and the Allied counter offensive picked up pace. This was followed by heavy fighting around <a href="Battle%20of%20Oivi%26amp%3Bndash%3BGorari">Oivi and Gorari</a>, which proved to be the final action of the Kokoda Track campaign prior to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%26amp%3Bndash%3BGona">Battle of Buna–Gona</a> as the Japanese were pursued back towards their beachheads on the northern Papuan coast.

After the war, a <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a> was awarded to Australian units for their involvement in the fighting around Kokoda and Deniki during late July and early August. This was designated "Kokoda – Deniki", and was awarded to the 39th Infantry Battalion and the <a href="Pacific%20Islands%20Regiment">Pacific Islands Regiment</a>, which was the successor to the Papuan Infantry Battalion.

Del Courtney was an <a href="United%20States">American</a> bandleader and occasional actor. His band played in the center of the field at San Francisco Giants games.

He attended <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">UC Berkley</a>,and while there he earned two degrees. One was a master's degree in music and the other a teachers degree. Instead of teaching, the career path he chose was that of a professional musician.

Having graduated from University, and having formed his first band at the Claremont Hotel, he became immensely popular in the Bay area. He was also getting record deals and contracts for radio shows. During the mid 1930s, he toured Seattle and playing the ballrooms and hotels there. It wasn't the most commercial of ventures so he returned to California. There he recorded regularly and played to full venues.

In the mid 1940s, he was playing at the Blackhawk Restaurant, a popular venue where he was a top-line favorite. In early 1948, Courtney was playing his sixth engagement at the Rose Room at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. At that time, his band consisted of trumpet players, George Rank, Seymour Solk, and Billy Petri. Trombone players were Rick Meyer and Johnny Strong. Saxophonists were Doug Lowery, Rick Sanders, Johnny Shepherd and Ken MacCoulou. The rhythm section consisted of Bob Moonan on Piano, Val Eddy on bass, Mel Severs on guitar, and Ellis Stickey on drums. The vocalists were Gloria Foster and Gil Vester. Lee Zhhito gave him a favorable review in the February 7 issue of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">The Billboard</a>" magazine.

In October 1958, his album "Dancing 'Til Daybreak" LP, which was released on Capiltol received a favorable review in "Billboard". It contained four songs and four medleys.

On the 3rd of July, 1964, both Courtney and Les Molloy became the owners of radio station <a href="KSAN%20%28defunct%29">KSAN</a>.

In the mid 1990s, he came out of retirement to occasionally front a big band. This was in response to what has been referred to as the "Swing revival". At the age of 93 but not in the best of health, he was playing once a month.

After a bout pneumonia that he had for a week, he died at Queen’s Medical Center in Honolulu aged 95 in February 2006.

He had part in the 1959 film "<a href="The%20Hideous%20Sun%20Demon">The Hideous Sun Demon</a>". In the <a href="Robert%20Clarke">Robert Clarke</a> directed sci-fi, he played the part of a radio DJ.

The corps was commanded by division commander Komkor <a href="Kasyan%20Chaykovsky">Kasyan Chaykovsky</a> and its chief of staff was <a href="Mikhail%20Bakshi">Mikhail Bakshi</a>. The <a href="31st%20Mechanized%20Brigade%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">31st Mechanized Brigade</a> was formed from the 32nd Rifle Regiment named for <a href="V.%20Volodarsky">Volodarsky</a>, the <a href="32nd%20Mechanized%20Brigade%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">32nd Mechanized Brigade</a> from the 33rd Rifle Regiment named for <a href="Semyon%20Voskov">Voskov</a>, the <a href="33rd%20Rifle%20and%20Machine%20Gun%20Brigade">33rd Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade</a> from the 31st Rifle Regiment named for <a href="Moisei%20Uritsky">Uritsky</a>.

The corps was ordered to counterattack German troops from the <a href="8th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">8th Infantry Division</a> advancing near Grodno. Two tank regiments of the 29th Tank Division attacked a "kampfgruppe" from Infantry-Regiment 84 and assault guns of Sturmgeschutz-Abeiltung 184. Division commander Studnev mistakenly identified the assault guns as tanks and halted the advance, allowing German air support and artillery to disable about half of the two regiments' tanks. The two regiments retreated after four hours. About fifty casualties were suffered by the 8th Infantry Division in the fighting. On 24 June the corps renewed the counterattacks, but was unable to help the <a href="6th%20Mechanized%20Corps%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">6th Mechanized Corps</a> due to a lack of radio communications.

The next Northern Cypriot parliamentary election is scheduled for 2017 or 2018, and will elect the 50 members of the <a href="Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20%28Northern%20Cyprus%29">Assembly of the Republic</a> of <a href="Northern%20Cyprus">Northern Cyprus</a> (TRNC) for another five-year term.

The last election was held on 28 July 2013, and resulted in a victory for <a href="%C3%96zkan%20Yorganc%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu">Özkan Yorgancıoğlu</a>, after his <a href="Republican%20Turkish%20Party">Republican Turkish Party</a> secured 38% of the vote and 21 seats. Their rivals in the <a href="National%20Unity%20Party%20%28Northern%20Cyprus%29">National Unity Party</a> fell to 27% of the vote and 14 seats. Two other parties – the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28Northern%20Cyprus%29">Democratic Party</a> and the <a href="Communal%20Democracy%20Party">Communal Democracy Party</a> – managed to enter parliament with 23% and 7% of the vote respectively. Due to a 5% <a href="election%20threshold">election threshold</a>, the <a href="United%20Cyprus%20Party">United Cyprus Party</a> failed to win any seats, having won only 3% of the vote.

The current <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Cyprus">Prime Minister of Northern Cyprus</a> is <a href="H%C3%BCseyin%20%C3%96zg%C3%BCrg%C3%BCn">Hüseyin Özgürgün</a>, who has served since 16 April 2016, and leads a coalition consisting of the National Unity Party and the Democratic Party.

The fifty members of the Assembly are elected by <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> in five <a href="Electoral%20district%23District%20magnitude">multi-member constituencies</a> with an <a href="electoral%20threshold">electoral threshold</a> of 5%. Voters can either vote for a <a href="party%20list">party list</a> or for individual candidates. If they chose the latter, they could cast as many votes as there were seats in a constituency.

The <a href="Northern%20Cyprus%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202013">2013 parliamentary elections</a> in Northern Cyprus resulted in the election of <a href="%C3%96zkan%20Yorganc%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu">Özkan Yorgancıoğlu</a> of the center-left <a href="Republican%20Turkish%20Party">Republican Turkish Party</a> (CTP) as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Cyprus">Prime Minister of Northern Cyprus</a>. His party formed a coalition with the right-leaning <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28Northern%20Cyprus%29">Democratic Party</a> (DP), led by <a href="Serdar%20Denkta%C5%9F">Serdar Denktaş</a>. Meanwhile, the nationalist <a href="National%20Unity%20Party%20%28Northern%20Cyprus%29">National Unity Party</a> (UBP) became the main opposition party.

The <a href="Northern%20Cyprus%20presidential%20election%2C%202015">2015 presidential elections</a> were held on 19 April, with a runoff the following week, on 26 April. In the first round of voting, the incumbent, UBP-backed President <a href="Dervi%C5%9F%20Ero%C4%9Flu">Derviş Eroğlu</a> received 30,328 votes, or slightly above 28% of the total. <a href="Mustafa%20Ak%C4%B1nc%C4%B1">Mustafa Akıncı</a>, a former <a href="member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> for the <a href="Communal%20Democracy%20Party">Communal Democracy Party</a> (TDP), came in second with 27%, while <a href="Sibel%20Siber">Sibel Siber</a> of the CTP and the independent candidate <a href="Kudret%20%C3%96zersay">Kudret Özersay</a> won 22.5% and 21% respectively. As a result, Eroğlu and Akıncı proceeded to a <a href="two-round%20system">second round of voting</a> on 26 April. Ultimately, Akıncı secured a landslide victory, securing 60.5% of the vote against 39.5% for Eroğlu. Akıncı was formally <a href="inauguration">inaugurated</a> as the fourth <a href="President%20of%20Northern%20Cyprus">President of Northern Cyprus</a> on 30 April 2015.

In part due to the poor performance of the CTP in the presidential race, <a href="Mehmet%20Ali%20Talat">Mehmet Ali Talat</a> challenged Prime Minister Yorgancıoğlu for the party leadership. In the event, Talat defeated the prime minister, triggering the latter's resignation. Since only MPs may serve in the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Northern%20Cyprus">Cabinet of Northern Cyprus</a>, Talat did not become prime minister; the position ultimately went to <a href="%C3%96mer%20Kalyoncu">Ömer Kalyoncu</a>, who was sworn in on 16 July 2015. Kalyoncu formed a <a href="grand%20coalition">grand coalition</a> consisting of CTP and UBP, as opposed to the former CTP–DP constellation. His administration was short-lived, however; <a href="H%C3%BCseyin%20%C3%96zg%C3%BCrg%C3%BCn">Hüseyin Özgürgün</a> managed to establish a <a href="right-wing%20politics">right-wing</a> coalition on 16 April 2016, consisting of UBD and the Democratic Party of <a href="Serdar%20Denkta%C5%9F">Serdar Denktaş</a>, the son of TRNC's "<a href="father%20of%20the%20nation">pater patriae</a>", <a href="Rauf%20Denkta%C5%9F">Rauf Denktaş</a>.

New Zealand Defence Stores Department

The Defence Stores Department was a department of the New Zealand Defence Department responsible for the purchase, receipt, issue and repair of stores, initially for the Armed Constabulary and then the Permanent and Volunteer Forces of New Zealand from 1867 to 1917.

To support Imperial Troops in the early years of the New Zealand Colony, Military Stores Depots were established by the British Army, Military Stores Department during 1856 at:

In 1866 Military Establishments were moved from Auckland to Wellington, this included the Military Stores Departments Depot at Fort Britomart.

With the withdrawal of Imperial Forces completed by July 1870, and the responsibility for defence matters handed over to the New Zealand Armed Constabulary, Defence store-keeping responsibility was handed over to the Colony's newly created Defence Stores Department.

On 23 April 1869 Lieutenant Colonel Edward Gorton, took up the appointment of Inspector of Defence Stores and head of the Defence Stores Department.
On the retirement of Colonel Gorten in 1878, Captain Sam Anderson, a Chief Clerk from the previous Military Stores Department with much experience , assumed the position of Defence Storekeeper, with Stores depots at;

In 1886 with the passing of the Defence Act (1886) and division of the New Zealand Constabulary Force into separate military and police forces, the Defence Stores Department became the stores agency for New Zealand's Defence Forces under control of the Department of the Under Secretary of Defence, essentially a civilian organisation of the Defence Department.

In 1888, due to financial constraints, the Auckland and Dunedin depots were abolished and their staff made redundant. Stocks necessary for the use of the volunteer units was placed under the charge of the local magazine keepers. This left Mount Cook as the Main Stores Deport for New Zealand. By 1894 the Staff of the Defence Stores Department at the Mount Cook Depot had grown, it was announced on 1 March 1894 that 18 staff were no longer required from 31 March 1894.

On 7 December 1899 the Defence Storekeeper Captain Sam Anderson passed away. This was at a critical time as two months previously the New Zealand Government had committed forces to the South Africa War, and as a result the Defence Stores Department after years of neglect was at breaking point due to the mobilisation. <a href="James%20O%27Sullivan%20%28Defence%20Storkeeper%29">J O'Sullivan</a> also employed by the Defence Stores for a number of years, succeeded Anderson as acting Defence Storekeeper.

Captain Sam Anderson is buried at St John's Anglican Church, Johnsonville, New Zealand.

In 1900 a Joint Defence (Secret) Committee was convened to investigate and make recommendation on the state of New Zealand Defence, as a result the committee made several recommendations in regards to the Defence Stores Department, notable were changes to the methods of ordering, receipting and issuing of military stores be made and that Stores Depots be established at the four main volunteer centers.
Parliamentary Estimates for the same year provided for the erection of Stores Depots in each center and finance allocated for;

In 1907 the Defence Forces under went a Command reorganisation with the creation of the Defence Council. This placed the Defence Store Department under the control of the Defence Council, with the position of "'Director of Ordnance Stores" was Created, with the responsibility for:

'clothing and personal equipment, accoutrements, saddlery,harness, small arms and small arms ammunition, machine guns, material, transport, vehicles, camp equipment and all stores required for the defence force' 

On 27 December 1907, James O'Sullivan was confirmed as the Director of Stores (Often referred to as Director of Ordnance Stores), with the Rank of Honorary Captain in the New Zealand Staff Corps.

Positions for permanent storekeepers was also authorised for each of the mobilisation locations and the following appointments were made:

In 1911 O'Sullivan, having been promoted to Major, with all members of the Defence Stores staff participating, conducted three weeks of training in November for 30 Men selected from the districts on the theory on the office and duties of the Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant. There is no doubt that in just under three years this training would be put to the test as the nation mobilised on an unprecedented scale.

Within weeks of the First World War been declared in August, New Zealand had mobilised and deployed an Expeditionary Force to capture and occupy German Samoa, whilst concurrently mobilising an Expeditionary Force for Europe, which would depart in October. Included in the first Contingent of the Expeditionary Force to Europe was <a href="William%20Thomas%20Beck">Captain W Beck</a> the Defence Storekeeper from Auckland, who deployed as the Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Services (DADOS), and would be the first New Zealander ashore at Gallipoli. Defence Stores Department was at the forefront of these efforts, supplying everything required for the mobilising forces. In addition to preparing the Expeditionary Forces, Defence Stores also had to ensure that the four existing Mobilisation Stores, (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin) were provided with adequate stock and that the additional Mobilisation Store established in Palmerston North was also provisioned to enable it to carry out its role.

By 1916 storage space and manpower was at a premium and Finance was approved to extend the Defence Stores building in Buckle Street and even though required for the operation of the Defence Stores, men of enlisting age were given the opportunity to enlist.

1916 led to further reorganization of the Defence Stores to bring their duties into line with military requirements. The Director of Stores assumed the military designation of Director of Equipment and Ordnance Stores, the District Storekeepers being designated "Assistant Directors of Equipment and Ordnance Stores." As Defence Stores were a section of the Quartermaster General Branch, a certain amount of dual roles and responsibilities existed, so much so that O'Sullivan had been made an Assistant Quartermaster in 1914. It was accepted that as experienced officers and non-commissioned officers became available the Defence Stores would be staffed by military personnel, and assume its true relation to the military Forces of New Zealand.

On 8 April 1916, Captain Thomas McCristell, the Trentham Camp Quartermaster was appointed to succeed Major O'Sullivan as Director of Equipment and Ordnance Stores. Major O'Sullivan moved on to the role of Inspector of Ordnance Stores

On reviewing the work of the Defence Stores Department since the start of the war, a vast improvement was noticeable in the methods of accounting, care and custody of arms, equipment, and stores throughout New Zealand, and in 1917 the decision was made that after close to 50 years service to the nation, on 1 April 1917 the Department would be replaced with a <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Ordnance%20Corps">New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps</a>(NZAOC) and a <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Ordnance%20Corps">New Zealand Army Ordnance Department</a>(NZAOD).

The <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Ordnance%20Corps">NZAOD</a> and <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Ordnance%20Corps">NZAOC</a> were gazetted on 1 April 1917, The effect placed the Defence Stores staff and those handling military equipment and stores in the districts and training camps on a straight-out military footing, the same as in the British Army. Regulations were gazetted in June 1917 and were modelled on British lines, and ended the anomaly of having civilians in the army who are really outside it and are not subject to military discipline and control. Defence stores staff and others doing the same work in the districts have been under the control of the Public Service, wore civilian clothes and now had purely military status, and would wear uniform.

Dirgantara Air Service Flight 3130

Dirgantara Air Service Flight 3130 (DIR3130/AW3130) was a scheduled domestic passenger flight operated by <a href="Dirgantara%20Air%20Service">Dirgantara Air Service</a> from Datah Dawai Airport, Malinau Regency, East Kalimantan to its provincial capital's airport, <a href="Temindung%20Airport">Samarinda Temindung Airport</a>, Samarinda, East Kalimantan. On 18 November 2000, the aircraft conducting the flight, a <a href="Britten%20Norman%20Islander">Britten Norman Islander BN-2</a> sheared tree tops and crashed onto the forest near the airport shortly after take off. Search and rescue team immediately found the wreckage of Flight 3130 and the survivors. No one was killed in the crash, but all 18 people on board were injured in the crash, 11 of them were seriously hurt.

The final report, published by the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Committee">National Transportation Safety Committee</a>, concluded that the crash was caused due to multiple factors, which were <a href="pilot%20error">pilot error</a>, overloading, and lack of safety in the airport (<a href="bribery">bribery</a>). The wrong perception by the pilot, added with the plane overloading that was caused by bribery, subsequently causing the plane to crash. The airline ceased operations in 2009 and officially went bankrupt in 2013.

The Britten Norman Islander took off at 10:51 local time, carrying a total of 17 passengers, including 2 infants and a 5 month-pregnant woman, and 1 crew member on board. Shortly after take off, the airport radio operator noticed that the aircraft disappeared behind the forest. The aircraft contacted the first tree and started to veering to the left. It then hit another tree and began zigzagging. The aircraft then contacted the third tree and started to lose control. The landing gear then struck the last contacted tree and then it crashed upside down onto the forest floor. Both wings were ripped off from the fuselage, with fuels leaking from the right wing tip. This causing a dangerous post-impact fire risk, as soil type in Borneo was often flammable.

A search and rescue party was quickly assembled by Datah Dawai Airport authorities shortly after the crash. The wreckage was eventually found 2 kilometers from the airport. All 18 people on board, including 2 infants and a 5-month pregnant woman, were injured with 11 of them were seriously hurt. The crew of the aircraft, identified as Captain Abdul Hayi, had to be transported to Jakarta due to broken legs. The injured were taken to local hospital and the Wahab Sjachrani Civic Hospital in Samarinda. The aircraft was a total loss, with the front section of the aircraft "totally wrecked". The rudder and the vertical stabilizers were found 7 meters from the main wreckage. The fuselage was crushed and bent severely. Passengers and crews initially trapped inside the wreckage. The seats inside the aircraft had to thrown out from the aircraft in order to evacuate the survivors.

The aircraft involved in the crash was a <a href="Britten%20Norman%20Islander">Britten Norman Islander BN-2</a>, registered in Indonesia as PK-VIY. Manufactured in 1981 in <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, it had accrued a total cycle of 22.336 hours. It had one crew seat and a total of 9 passenger seats. It had an airworthiness certificate published on 27 September 2000. All passengers and crew on board were Indonesian citizen. The one and only crew, Captain Abdul Hayi, had accrued a total flying hours of 7.560 

The aerodrome is owned by the local government and used for pioneer flight operations. The coordinates are 00 47 North, 114 34 East. The elevation is not officially published, only measured from the aircraft altimeter, which is about 650 ft above sea level. The runway designation is 02 and 20. The length of the runway is 750 meter with width of 23 meter. A stopway of 30 meter is provided for runway 02. The runway surface is asphalt and its strength can accommodate up to <a href="CASA%20212">CASA 212</a> aircraft. It has an apron, taxiway, but a tower building is not available since the aerodrome is a non controlled aerodrome. The runway is not equipped with landing direction indicators and, due to local prevailing surface winds at most of the time, the preferred take off and landing direction is runway 02. A significant obstacle is the hilly forest in the northerly direction of the extension of runway 02. The first obstacle is about 200 feet high above runway elevation located about 533.3 meters from the end of runway 02, and the second obstacle is about 500 feet above runway elevation 1.262,9 meters from the end of runway 02. Runway slope inclination is 3% from direction of runway 02.

Investigators inspected the wreckage of Flight 3130 and found that there was not a single indication of a rotation on the propeller during the crash. Further inspection on the wreckage revealed that the propeller, mixture and throttle levers were all the way back. This indicated that the engine might have not running at the time of the crash. The engine could have been shutdown by Captain Abdul. There are three possibilities that caused the shutdown; those are engine fire, engine failure, or an emergency procedure.

The propellers didn't have any indications of an engine fire. The propellers were found in fine pitch and unfeathered position, which indicating an improper engine shutdown procedure. The wreckage indicated that the propeller levers position was not caused by the impact. All the levers on the pedestal were bent to the left due to impact from the right side. It is possible that Captain Abdul may not have time to perform a proper engine shutdown procedure. This, and the fact that the settings for both engines were the same indicate that a single engine failure did not occur. One sparkplugs from each cylinder was examined. The plugs were dry and clean indicating there were no signs of combustion failure.

Investigators interviewed the survivors. Based on survivors' statements, they claimed that the aircraft was handling more passengers than usual. The usual number of passengers was 9, as the maximum number of passenger seats are 9. While at the time, it reached 17. A row of seat that usually was occupied by 2 people had to be cramped up to 4 people, causing most of the passengers to not wear their seatbelts. These, causing the high number of injuries. During the initial climb, the aircraft didn't gain height and subsequently crashed. Survivors blamed overloading for the cause of the accident. An analysis on the weight and balance of Flight 3130 was conducted. Dirgantara Air Service's <a href="Standard%20Operating%20Procedures">Standard Operating Procedures</a> stated that the maximum take off payload from Datah Dawai was limited to 496 kilograms, while the actual take off payload was 913.5 kg, exceeding the company standards by 417.5 kg, or by 84% of the allowed payload weight. Britten Norman issued the maximum take-off weight (for Datah Dawai Airport elevation, which is 650 ft) is 6.300 lbs or 2.860 kg. The aircraft take off weight at Datah Dawai was 6.572 kilograms, exceeded manufacturer maximum take off weight by 272 lbs or 4.32%. However, Dirgantara Air Service argued from the manual that the maximum take off weight is 6.600 lbs. The center of gravity calculated is still inside the moment flight envelope, but close to the aft limit of the envelope. The aircraft take-off trim was set to near -1, meaning that the center of gravity was slightly aft.

Calculation of the flight performance indicated that with a reported 6.007 lbs aircraft weight (allowable for Datah Dawai according to the airline's SOP) and two engines operation, the aircraft could climb as high as 200 ft height from the runway elevation at 533.3 meter range (first segment climb). The aircraft should be able to reach 500 ft at 1.261 meters range (second segment climb). This performance capability will assure a safe clearance from existing obstacles. Using a linearized performance model, applying the actual weight of 6.572 lbs, the net gradient climb was calculated to be 12.6%. A correction factor applied to the linearized model resulting in an estimated climb gradient of 11%. With this climb gradient the aircraft can only reach 176 ft at 533.3m range, instead of the required 200 ft. At 176 ft above airport ground level, the aircraft height above the top of the trees was 11 ft (marginal).

The aircraft performed a take-off with dual engine operations and rotated at a speed of 70 knots. Based on interviews, the moment the aircraft took off from Datah Dawai, the aircraft seems to not gain any height, whether from <a href="downdraft">downdraft</a>, engine failure, or both. Noticing that the aircraft didn't gain height, Captain Abdul decided to turn back to the airport and rolled the aircraft to the left in order to avoid high trees. This maneuver, turning back to the airport by veered to the left, was not based on published procedures or visual track charts, as there were not available for departures from runway 02. The investigation also did not find any published information on emergency return to base maneuvers. Realizing that the aircraft continued to lose altitude, Captain Abdul prepared for an emergency landing. There was literally no time to conduct a proper emergency procedure, as the aircraft continued to fell with a sharp nose down pitch.

For a Datah Dawai departure, the 1st flight segment covers a 1.600 ft range, and the aircraft should have gained 200 ft altitude from runway. The flight, however, did only reach an altitude of 150 ft from the runway elevation at a range of 6.000 ft. This evidence proved that Flight 3130 was overloaded. An interview with Captain Abdul revealed that he had a habit of taking off from Datah Dawai at 70 knots, faster than the aircraft recommended take-off speed of 55-60 knots. He mentioned that doing so would improve his obstacle clearance performance. The mindset/perception Captain Abdul received is incorrect, as because if the aircraft took off at 70 knots, the distance between the aircraft and the obstacles (high ground and trees) became smaller. Because the distance between the aircraft and the obstacles became smaller, the aircraft should climb at a higher climb rate. Because it was overloaded, the aircraft did climb, but its speed would decrease. After clearing the obstacle, the aircraft would have lost too much speed that it can no longer gain any height. This combination, causing Flight 3130, to stall.

Dirgantara Air Service claimed that there were only 9 passengers aboard the plane. Examination of the load manifest and passenger tickets, along with interviews with the passengers, showed that only 12 of the 18 passengers have valid tickets. Passengers' weight were not measured correctly at Datah Dawai. The fact that Captain Abdul or the ground crew didn't object with the possible overloading indicates that there was a common practice or understanding on making extra-illegal profits from this practice. Most probably, such practice has been done before.

The investigation found that the crew of Dirgantara Air Service has never filled out a Flight Clearance for all its operation from Samarinda. This is a violation of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations (CASR). The airport briefing office should sign the flight clearance and therefore supervise the process. In Pioneer Flight operations, the local government requires the operator to hire local businesses/human resources in the operation, such as for the ticket agents, suppliers, etc. Dirgantara Air Service Area Manager in Samarinda mentioned that in many cases, the local personnel are not qualified or do not have the right to work in airline operation, but have to be hired anyway. This might influence the safety level of the operation. The investigation found that there were two different load manifests. The original manifests are obtained by the police at Tenggarong District and was suspected to be from Datah Dawai, compromised of seven adult, one child, and one infant with several baggages. The second manifest, numbered 012905, is suspected made in Samarinda. The number on the top right of the document is pasted over, obviously to cover the document's real number. The manifest stated that there are 8 adults, 2 children and 2 infants aboard the aircraft and there are no baggages. This is a gross violation of aviation safety procedures that can be classified as willful misconduct if not considered as criminal act.

Since the pioneer flight operation is subsidized by the local government, there are some issues related to the funding, the operator has to compensate by selling the ticket at very low price so that common people can afford to fly. This made the passenger demand very high. However, the airline can not make the decision to add the number of flights. The local government, as the sponsor, is the one that has the authority to decide. The high demand and low supply raise the potency of bribery. Without strong supervision, the airline employee or authority may take bribe from passengers who do not want to wait in line.

The passengers reported that Captain Abdul made a deal for the sale of seats to the last two passengers for Rp 60.000 and Rp 1 million (the actual ticket price is Rp 68.000). The passengers agreed to pay the prices so that they can be included in the flight. Captain Abdul confirmed that such deals are common and that he has done this before how ever he did mention the price. Captain Abdul and his chief pilot stated that such practices are often carried out alongside with their colleagues to get extra money to compensate their lower salary compared to the skill and service they have to provide the company assignment.

Although Dirgantara Air Service did issue notices to all personnel and staffs about the consequences of such in-disciplinary action, Dirgantara Air Service never implemented such control. This lack of control suggested that the personnel who are involved in such practices have built a belief that this unauthorized practice were actually rewarding and at any opportunity would repeat again.

The practice mentioned above become a safety hazard when the crews, lured by the amount of money they will get and knowing that there will be no adverse consequences on them, started to neglect the operating limits of the aircraft. All of these can be classified as criminal act, and a disregard of safety.

The NTSC concluded the final report and the cause of the crash. The crash was caused by Captain Abdul's wrong perception while taking off. He thought that with a higher velocity, he would achieve the optimum take off performance, while doing so would only get the aircraft nearer to the obstacle. This forced the aircraft to climb and pitched higher, while the plane was overloaded due to Captain Abdul and the ground crews that let more passengers loaded into the aircraft than the number of seats available. This overloading was caused due to miscalculation of the overall weight, accepting passengers' bribe, and the absence of supervision system that would prevent such practice. As the aircraft climbed with a higher climb rate, the speed of the aircraft began to drop. By the time Flight 3130 had cleared from its obstacle, it had lost too much speed. The aircraft lose its altitude and crashed onto the forest.

Arthur Giesl von Gieslingen was born in <a href="Cracow">Krakau</a> in 1857, as the son of general Heinrich Karl Giesl von Gieslingen. He was the elder brother of <a href="Baron%20Wladimir%20Giesl%20von%20Gieslingen">Wladimir Giesl von Gieslingen</a>.

After having been educated at the <a href="Theresian%20Military%20Academy">Theresian Military Academy</a>, Giesl von Gieslingen was posted to a regiment of dragoons in 1875. Between 1877-1887 Giesl von Gieslingen worked for the Austrian military intelligence, the <a href="Evidenzbureau">Evidenzbureau</a>. In 1887 he became orderly officer to <a href="Rudolf%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Austria">Crown Prince Rudolf</a>.

Restaurant Andrew Fairlie

Restaurant Andrew Fairlie, also known as Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles, is a restaurant serving <a href="British%20cuisine">British cuisine</a> located within the <a href="Gleneagles%20Hotel">Gleneagles Hotel</a> near <a href="Auchterarder">Auchterarder</a>, <a href="Perth%20and%20Kinross">Perth and Kinross</a>, Scotland. In operation since 2001, it is run by chef <a href="Andrew%20Fairlie%20%28chef%29">Andrew Fairline</a> alongside his <a href="head%20chef">head chef</a> Stevie McLaughlin. It currently holds two <a href="Michelin%20stars">Michelin stars</a>, having been awarded them in 2006.

After winning the inaugural <a href="Roux%20Scholarship">Roux Scholarship</a>, chef <a href="Andrew%20Fairlie%20%28chef%29">Andrew Fairlie</a> worked in a number of kitchens. This included winning a <a href="Michelin%20star">Michelin star</a> as the head chef of the restaurant at <a href="One%20Devonshire%20Gardens">One Devonshire Gardens</a> in London, before setting up his first restaurant, the self-titled Restaurant Andrew Fairlie, in 2001. Both his head chef Stevie McLaughlin and general manager Dale Dewsbury came with Fairlie when he transitioned from One Deveonshire Gardens to Restaurant Andrew Fairlie. McLaughlin had worked his way up from <a href="sous%20chef">sous chef</a>, with other head chefs during this period including Darin Campbell.

To celebrate the restaurant's 15 years in operation, in 2016, <a href="Michel%20Roux">Michel Roux</a> and <a href="Alain%20Roux">Alain Roux</a> will re-create some of the signature dishes from the their three Michelin star restaurant <a href="The%20Waterside%20Inn">The Waterside Inn</a> in <a href="Bray%2C%20Berkshire">Bray, Berkshire</a>. The collaboration will take place over two nights, with dishes from both restaurants appearing on a <a href="set%20menu">set menu</a>.

Restaurant Andrew Fairlie is located within the <a href="Gleneagles%20Hotel">Gleneagles Hotel</a> near <a href="Auchterarder">Auchterarder</a>, <a href="Perth%20and%20Kinross">Perth and Kinross</a>, Scotland. It is located within the interior of the hotel; the dining room has no windows. Fairlie was heavily involved in the design approach for the decoration, selecting a textured deep black-brown paint by <a href="Farrow%20%26amp%3B%20Ball">Farrow & Ball</a> for the walls. Many of the design components featured in the restaurant are bespoke; the black crockery was created by John Maguire, as are the chandeliers and carpet. Gregor Mathieson was hired to design the space, and later became Fairlie's business partner at the restaurant. They were inspired by the works of <a href="Archie%20Forrest">Archie Forrest</a>, and placed works by the artist on the walls of the dining room. The restaurant leased a walled Victorian-style <a href="kitchen%20garden">kitchen garden</a>, some away from the hotel.

When the restaurant first opened, Fairlie said that the dishes served were exacting in their requirements. He recalled a pork dish "that had three elements and they all had to be in proportion in terms of size and form". He added that the design of the plates himself were once important to him, saying "There are certain dishes I'd never put on a rectangular plate - chicken breast or a whole pigeon, for example. It just wouldn't look right." At one point, Fairlie sought to recreate the deconstruction style of dishes seen at restaurants such as <a href="El%20Bulli">El Bulli</a> and <a href="El%20Celler%20de%20Can%20Roca">El Celler de Can Roca</a>, which he called a "silly period" and reverted following customer feedback.

Following the introduction of a du marche (market) menu, Fairlie said that this allowed them to be more creative with a freeform plating style. This menu was created on the basis of the availability of produce from suppliers described by Fairlie as "flexible, changing, exciting and interesting" and allowed the restaurant to place dishes on the menu which otherwise would never have been served at the restaurant. Since 2012, Fairlie has been delegating the creation of some dishes to McLaughlin, with both their designs appearing on the menu. With the kitchen garden in production, the hope was that would enable them to reintroduce unusual heritage flavours from Scotland.

Restaurant Andrew Fairlie has a close connection with <a href="Champagne%20Krug">Champagne Krug</a>. Following the launch of the vintage Krug Clos d’Ambonnay 2000, Fairlie and McLaughlin cooked for a barbecue party held in the restaurant's walled kitchen garden in 2015 by the vintners. The restaurant was one of ten restaurants in the UK to be selected to hold a full allocation of six bottles of the new vintage. Krug Champagnes are popular at the restaurant, with Krug Grand Cuvee being matched to the signature tasting dish of smoked <a href="lobster">lobster</a>. This dish is created by removing the meat from the lobster shells, which is then <a href="cold%20smoking">cold smoked</a> over whisky casks. It is then placed back in the shells and baked at a high temperature with butter, herbs and lime juice.

Gillian Glover visited the restaurant in 2004 for "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>", calling the lobster dish with lime and herb butter "so compelling public demand will ensure the poor chap is still smoking lobster shells in his eighties". She agreed with her dining partner that the meal was the best she had eaten in Scotland. Richard Bath, of the newspaper "<a href="Scotland%20on%20Sunday">Scotland on Sunday</a>", was apprehensive of the complexity of the dishes when he visited the restaurant in 2008. However, he was pleased at the "unfussiness" of the menu, praising the veal loin served with veal shin and sweetbreads.

When asked about female chefs at Restaurant Andrew Fairlie, she added "We’ve always had women in our kitchen here. Girls have a calming influence on the boys. They have more elegance in their cooking than guys, and because they have smaller, more delicate hands they can do better in plating up and presentation of small items like game birds."

Christian Satin

Christian Satin (born 1946) is a painter born in Brussels during the post-war baby boom. He began painting with oil on canvas as a nine-year-old, first borrowing from impressionist techniques, going through a cubist period, before turning towards <a href="Surrealism">Surrealism</a>. He started exhibiting and selling his early works as a teenager; this part of his career ended in1966. His last exhibition was at the Gallery Piranèse together with three other young and upcoming artists. Satin gradually abandoned painting for architecture, one of his reasons was <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breton">André Breton</a>’s death which seemed to mark the end of the surrealist movement. He graduated in architecture in 1970 from the Academy of Fine Arts in Liège. After nearly fifty years spent without touching a paintbrush, Christian Satin rejoined surrealism in 2012, giving it a new form: trans-realism.

Trans-realism is the expression of immersive situations and images intended to blur the demarcation line between imagination and reality. Satin paints trans-realist <a href="triptych">triptychs</a> in which coherence between time is interrupted by the insertion of scenes that create another reality. His vision "flows from the current perception of the world at the heart of a universe, where the reality of apparent experience is integrated into space-time; a theatre of apparently chance transformations in the cosmos, and our singular and precarious perception of the quotidian. Similarly, the universe and evolution impose their superior changes onto the potential and imaginative capacity of the brain."

After returning to painting, Christian Satin exhibited his work at the Venta Gallery in Liège in 2014 as well as at the Expo Tempo Gallery in Knokke. The town of Liège and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation set up a major retrospective exhibition at the Grand Curtius Museum entitled: “Christian Satin: Painter and Architect” in March 2015.

From the end of the 1960s and for the next forty-five years, Christian Satin was better known as an architect and as a professor. In 1973, he opened his architecture firm, AGE Engineering.
He collaborated in competitions with architects such as <a href="Jean%20Nouvel">Jean Nouvel</a>, <a href="Kengo%20Kuma">Kengo Kuma</a>, <a href="Architecture-Studio">Architecture-Studio</a>. He was President of the Liège Provincial Order of Architects and Head of the Walloon Chamber.
One of his accomplishments is Le Vertbois. His use of red paint for the facade was harshly criticised in the press at the time but the colour has since become a "classic" in <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a>.

Christian Satin was awarded the Urban Planning Prize of Liège in 1991 for the building Maréchal in Rue Cathédrale.
In 1996, Satin was awarded the title Knight of the Order of the Crown by His Majesty King <a href="Albert%20II%20of%20Belgium">Albert II of Belgium</a>.
In 2015, Satin received the Bruggenbouwer award from the Institut royal des Élites du Travail, Belgium.

The card was initially planned to launch in August 2016 but was delayed until at least 2017 as the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning required more time to integrate the ticketing systems of the different rail networks.

Cobourg Hotel

Cobourg Hotel was a hotel in <a href="Tenby">Tenby</a>, Pembrokeshire, Wales, situated at the northwest of the High Street, where it joins Crackwell Street. Though an inn had existed on the spot before 1800, a new hotel was built in 1816, and it one of the principal hotels of Tenby. It was in the possession of the Hughes family for much of its history until it was converted into flats in 1982. The current building is known as Ashley Court, and it became a Grade II listed property in 1966.

Historically the hotel was one of the main inns in the towns, when it was named the Cobourg Hotel and run by the Hughes family.
A hotel is known to have existed in the spot in 1798, though an inscription dated to 1816 on the stairs incidates that it had been rebuilt then by William Maddox, and completed by Ambrose Smith and William Lewis after Maddox's death in 1815. 

George Hughes ran the hotel after it opened in 1816 until his death on 18 December 1821. His widow, Elizabeth took control and was proprietor until her own death in 1835. Her son, James Hughes, a shipping agent who operated a steamship business between Tenby and <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> then ran the hotel with his wife Maria. Hughes was appointed chief magistrate of the town in 1840-41. After his death in September 1857, Maria took over the hotel and was in charge until her death in 1883, after nearly fifty years at the Cobourg. 

Maria's youngest son John Bilbie Hughes succeeded her as landlord of the hotel, but six years later his died of gout at just 45, leaving his widow Joyce to co-operate the hotel along with the <a href="Royal%20Station%20Hotel">Royal Station Hotel</a> in Bath until she passed in March 1923. Her eldest daughter Gladys succeeded her, and ran them until her death in December 1954. Her son, John Alexander Horner, ran the hotel until finally in 1982 he announced his retirement. The hotel wine cellar and belongings were auctioned off in the November. An application the following month by the Rural and Coastal Developments of Coventry was approved to convert the hotel into four shops and 15 flats.

The current building, Ashley Court, is four storeys with a four-bay stuccoed front with <a href="oriel%20window">oriel windows</a> has been converted into flats, but retains a later 19th century look. The large rear wing of four storeys, on the southwest side, and overlooks Upper Frog Street. Ashley Court became a Grade II listed building on 22 February 1966.

Wargrave War Memorial

Wargrave War Memorial is <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">First World War memorial</a> in the village of <a href="Wargrave">Wargrave</a> (near <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>) in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, south-eastern England. Designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, the memorial was unveiled in 1922 and is today a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens designed <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London, which became the focus for the national <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> commemorations, as well as the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a>—the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world—and the <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> which appears in all large <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. Wargrave's memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses by Lutyens, all sharing a broadly similar design.

Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, Lutyens established his reputation by designing country houses for wealthy clients. Many of Lutyens' commissions for war memorials originated with pre-war friends and clients. His connection with Wargrave apparently came from the Hannen family—<a href="Nicholas%20Hannen%20%28actor%29">Nicholas "Beau" Hannen</a> worked as an apprenticeship in Lutyens' office between 1902 and 1905, and Lutyens designed the <a href="Hannen%20Columbarium">Hannen Columbarium</a> for the family in 1905, which stands in Wargrave churchyard.

A public meeting in Wargrave, held on 13 October 1919, agreed to commission Lutyens to design a War Cross for the village, and to fund a bed for the <a href="Royal%20Berkshire%20Hospital">Royal Berkshire Hospital</a>, subject to sufficient funding. A target of £600 was set, of which £500 was raised within eight months of the meeting and a Henry Bond donated a piece of land on the village green, which the committee and Lutyens agreed was a suitable location during a site visit by the architect. Lutyens prepared designs by August 1920, which were approved at a further meeting in November of the same year.

The memorial stand on the village green, towards the southern end. It follows Lutyens' War Cross design as a single cross in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> with a long, tapering shaft to which the short arms are moulded close to the top. Uniquely among Lutyens' War Crosses, it has a <a href="hexagon">hexagonal</a>, rather than rectangular, profile, which continues down the shaft and through the plinth. The whole memorials sits on a base of four stone steps (also hexagonal, on the same alignment), of which the lowest is much deeper than the others, with a single stone block serving as a step at the front. The unusual shape led Tim Skelton, author of "Lutyens and the Great War" (2008) to describe Wargrave as "the most distinguished of all of Lutyens' War Crosses". The plinth contains the inscriptions "WARGRAVE / MCMXIV MCMXIX / MCMXXXIX MXMXLV" and "HER GLORIOUS DEAD / MCMXIV MCMXIX / MCMXXXIX MXMXLV" on the south (front) and north (rear) faces, respectively. The names of the fallen are inscribed around the plinth. As these became worn, they were supplemented by two stone tablets set into the grass in front of the cross, which also contain several additional names.

The memorials was unveiled by Field Marshal <a href="Sir%20William%20Robertson%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir William Robertson</a> on 28 May 1922 and dedicated by <a href="Hubert%20Burge">Hubert Burge</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Oxford">Bishop of Oxford</a>.

Wargrave War Memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> on 23 December 1983. In November 2015, as part of the commemorations of the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens's war memorials were recognised as a "national collection" and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> list entries were updated and expanded.

BVG Class F are trains that run on the <a href="Berlin%20U-Bahn">Berlin U-Bahn</a>.

In West Berlin, the new "F" type followed the D and DL types. These trains were longer, built from light metal and had a different seating arrangement, with the two double seats at 90 degrees to the sides of the train. A test vehicle was built in 1973, it was scrapped in December 2006.

F74 trains were delivered from 1974 to 1978, mainly deployed to U9, 68 trains were built, and transferred all the D60 trains to U6, mainly to replace the D57 trains which shifted to U8 to replace the final 45-year old train cars.

In 1980 a new variation called "F79" was introduced, 37 trains were built. It used the new <a href="three-phase%20electric%20power">three-phase electric power</a>, which would be used on all future models as well. They are divided into three phases (F79.1, F79.2 and F79.3).

Later the "F84" and "F87" followed, but there were no major changes to the basic design.

From 1990 on, the BVG bought more trains, which were called "F90"/"F92", which also featured no major changes. Minor changes included improved automatic doors that closed more quietly.

Prior to 1990, most of the trains have their "U-Bahn" logo as a destination display on it, before they have a line number rolled out.

Mathys Schoevaerdts

Mathys Schoevaerdts or Matthijs Schoevaerdts (c. 1665/1667 – after 1702) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He is known mainly for his <a href="Landscape%20art">landscapes</a> with trees, marines and <a href="genre%20art">genre scenes</a>. He started out in the tradition of <a href="Jan%20Brueghel%20the%20Elder">Jan Brueghel the Elder</a> and later developed towards an Italianate style.

Details about the life of Mathys Schoevaerdts are scarce. The earliest records about the artist date from 1682, the year in which he began his apprenticeship with the landscape painter <a href="Adriaen%20Frans%20Boudewijns">Adriaen Frans Boudewijns</a>. This makes it likely that he was born somewhere between 1665 and 1667 assuming the age at which apprenticeships typically started was 15 to 17 years. His birthplace was likely Brussels.
Mathys Schoevaerdts was admitted as a master of the Brussels <a href="Guild%20of%20Saint%20Luke">Guild of Saint Luke</a> in 1690. He served as a Dean of the Guild from 1692 to 1696.

His work was highly appreciated during his lifetime and was widely collected throughout the 18th century. He spent time in the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>.

His latest dated work is dated to 1702. It is believed that he died soon thereafter. A document from 1712 states that by then he was dead.

Mathys Schoevaerdts is known for his landscape art and genre scenes. His landscapes are full of anecdotes and delicately painted scenes of peasants travelling, sailing or attending kermesses. His early works show the influence of the market views and other crowded scenes of <a href="Jan%20Brueghel%20the%20Elder">Jan Brueghel the Elder</a>. He had the same preference for the use of delicate light blues and greens as Brueghel. Jan Brueghel the Elder started the tradition of landscape paintings with decorative scenes in the early 17th century. His style had a strong hold well into the 18th century on the next generations of Flemish painters including <a href="Izaak%20van%20Oosten">Izaak van Oosten</a>, <a href="Peeter%20Gijsels">Peeter Gijsels</a>, Adriaen Frans Boudewijns, <a href="Pieter%20Bout">Pieter Bout</a>, various members of the <a href="Peeter%20van%20Bredael">van Bredael</a> family, <a href="Balthasar%20Beschey">Balthasar Beschey</a>, <a href="Carel%20Beschey">Carel Beschey</a> and finally <a href="Th%C3%A9obald%20Michau">Théobald Michau</a>. Typical of all their landscapes is the bucolic sense of happiness, and their small figures in anecdotic, detailed poses set against a backdrop of a pleasing landscape or buildings.

Because of their similarity in subject matter and style, Schoevaerdts' unsigned paintings have been mistaken for those of his master Adriaen Frans Boudewijns and <a href="Pieter%20Bout">Pieter Bout</a>.
Schoevaerdts' compositions are typicall filled with many figures. The figure groups are individualized and carefully observed. He sometimes introduced elements of fantasy in his compositions by including exotic-looking Turkish merchants into Flemish village scenes. He progressively developed a personal style where the events and scenes depicted are rendered with special accuracy.

Schoevaerdts came later under the influence of the Dutch and Flemish artists who worked in Rome known as the <a href="Bamboccianti">Bamboccianti</a>. He then started to paint landscapes with Italianate ports and ruins. The imaginative ruins or buildings in these landscapes were often decorated with foliage, which emphasises their dilapidated state. He re-used similar figures and architecture in different combinations in his landscapes. These Italianate landscapes revealed increasing depth and delicacy in the handling of the paint. He painted with a bright, clear palette and many of his landscapes include an atmospheric sunset or misty blue mountains in the far distance.

He sometimes collaborated with his teacher Boudewyns and with other artists such as F Dupont (1660-1712), who provided the figures in his landscapes. His brother Frans Schoevaerdts was also a painter active in Brussels in the beginning of the 18th century. The brothers created together lively and animated ideal classical landscapes.

Schoevaerdts' landscapes generally depicted imaginary views. Some more realistic views he painted include <a href="Capriccio%20%28art%29">capriccio</a>’s” of views of Italy, a country that he never visited: one a view of Rome and the other a view of Venice. The artist must have relied on engravings for these more realistically looking landscapes. Schoevaerdts painted one topographical painting representing Maximilian II Emanuel in front of the Coudenberg palace of Brussels.

Schoevaerdts also produced a small number of engravings depicting genre scenes. An example is .

Lambeth Pier

Lambeth Pier is a pier on the <a href="Albert%20Embankment">Albert Embankment</a>, near <a href="Lambeth%20Bridge">Lambeth Bridge</a>, on the south side of the <a href="Thames">Thames</a> in London, England. It has been part of a ferry service up to the mid-18th century, and now serves pleasure rides and cruises along the river.

There has been a landing facility for boats here since <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a>. It became the primary crossing point between <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a> and <a href="Westminster%20Palace">Westminster Palace</a> for the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. A horse ferry was in operation by 1513, as it was one of the few places along the Thames that accommodate such a service. It sank in 1633, and again in 1656 while carrying <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s coach. <a href="Mary%20of%20Modena">Mary of Modena</a> used the ferry to escape to France during the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>. The service closed following the opening of <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a> in 1750.

Since the closure of the ferry service, the pier has been used for leisure trips along the Thames. In the 19th century there were "constant stoppages" of steamboats at the pier. In 1961 <a href="Decca%20Radar">Decca Radar</a>'s training school moved to the area from <a href="Blackfriars%2C%20London">Blackfriars</a>. In 1860, the pier was moved further out into the river following the construction of the <a href="Albert%20Embankment">Albert Embankment</a>.

<a href="Capital%20Cruises">Capital Cruises</a> were operating at Lambeth and <a href="Tower%20Millennium%20Pier">Tower Piers</a> by the 1980s. Today, <a href="Thames%20Cruises">Thames Cruises</a> operate from the pier. Tidal Cruises has run pleasure services from Lambeth Pier since the 1980s.

On 9 October 1888, a body was found floating in the Thames, from where it was taken to Lambeth Pier and identified as a woman aged about 29, before being transported to the mortuary. Although the incident occurred at the height of the <a href="Whitechapel%20Murders">Whitechapel Murders</a>, and the similar <a href="Whitehall%20Mystery">Whitehall Mystery</a> murder around the same time, it is not believed to be linked to any of these.

On 20 August 1989, the Tidal Cruises-owned <a href="Marchioness%20disaster">Marchioness</a> sank when it collided with a dredger, killing 51 people. In 1999, 120 passengers and crew on the Symphony were evacuated at Lambeth Pier after the vessel struck Lambeth Bridge. There were no injuries.

Where were you / Kga mi or

Where were you () is 2015 song by Armenian singer <a href="Sirusho">Sirusho</a>. It was released on 24 April 2015 as a single dedicated to the Armnian genocide Centennial commemoration.

Where Were You (Kga Mi Or) is sung in Armenian and English. The song is dedicated to the centennial of The <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide of 1915</a> and the official video of the song displays some shots from that event. <a href="Sirusho">Sirusho</a> is the author of English lyrics that were co-written together with Rama Duke, Elaine Tsaghikyan, who wrote the first verse of the song. The Armenian lyrics were written by a famous Armenian songwriter <a href="Avet%20Barseghyan">Avet Barseghyan</a>. Here again, <a href="Sirusho">Sirusho</a> is representing the mixture of the Armenian traditional rhythms with modern music. The song created a big campaign on Instagram and Facebook by people posting photos with the same black line on the face as in her music video representing sorrow and pain.

Both the Armenian and English versions of Where Were You are presented in one video. The song starts off in a relaxing, voice-over way before Sirusho unleashes her power in the chorus, holding those long, high notes and expressing the pain of the song, which overtly references the <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> in this, the centenary year of the tragedy. The song seamlessly mixes modern pop with traditional Armenian sounds.

As in her music video for <a href="PreGomesh">PreGomesh</a>, <a href="Sirusho">Sirusho</a> is wearing exquisite Armenian traditional garments in her music video for Where Were You, thus keeping up her completely news approach to Armenian historical and cultural traditions.

 After the music video was released, she posted a Facebook status "My recent works are inspired by the Armenian beats. The folk dance "Yerek Votk of Lori" both with its rhythmical structure and the dance steps, is used as a basis on which we created a completely new song and dance. Throughout our history, even in the most difficult times, we were able to find strength and courage through singing and dancing. This is a characteristic of a strong nation, which i'm very proud of".

Each language has its own message. The Armenian lyrics are what I feel I want to say to the Armenians. The English lyrics are question or a demand addressed to the "indifferent" world. I want to say Thank You to the great people i worked with on this project.

<doc id="51575301" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51575301" title="Chief Court Mistress">
Chief Court Mistress

Court Mistress (; Dutch: "hofmesterees" ('Court mistress'); <a href="German%20language">German</a>: "hofmeisterin"; ; ) or Chief Court Mistress (; Dutch: "Grootmeesteres" ('Grand Mistress') <a href="German%20language">German</a>: "Obersthofmeisterin"; ; ; Russia: "Ober-Hofmeisterin") is/was the title of the senior <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> in the courts of Austria, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and the German princely and royal courts as well as Imperial Russia. 

In 1619, a set organisation was finally established for the Austrian Imperial court which came to be the characteristic organisation of the Austrian-Habsburg court roughly kept from this point onward. 
The first rank of the female courtiers was the "<a href="Obersthofmeisterin">Obersthofmeisterin</a>", who was second in rank after the empress herself, and responsible for all the female courtiers. Whenever absent, she was replaced by the "Fräuleinhofmeisterin", normally in charge of the unmarried female courtiers, their conduct and service. 







The early modern Danish court was organized according to the German court model, in turn inspired by the Imperial Austrian court model, from the 16th century onward.

The highest rank female courtier to a female royal was the "<a href="hofmesterinde">hofmesterinde</a>" (Court Mistress) from 1694/98 onward named "<a href="Overhofmesterinde">Overhofmesterinde</a>" (Chief Court Mistres), equivalent to the Mistress of the Robes, normally an elder widow, who supervised the rest of the ladies-in-waiting.
















The Austrian court model was the role model for the princely courts in Germany, and the post of Obersthofmeisterin, or only "hofmeisterin", existed in the princely (and later royal) German courts as well. 

The German court model in turn became the role model of the early modern Scandinavian courts of Denmark and Sweden.

In the 16th-century, the principal lady-in-waiting in the courts of the Habsburg governors of the Netherlands, Margaret of Austria and <a href="Mary%20of%20Hungary%20%28governor%20of%20the%20Netherlands%29">Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)</a>, was named "hofmesterees" ('Court mistress') or "dame d'honneur". 

The principal female office holder in the royal court of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a> in the 19th-century was named "Grootmeesteres" ('Grand Mistress').

During the union of Sweden-Norway in 1814–1905, Sweden and Norway shared the same royal family. At that time, there were two Chief Court Mistress for the same queen: one as Queen of Sweden at the Swedish royal court when she lived in Sweden, and a separate Chief Court Mistress as Queen of Norway at the Norwegian royal court, who served in her post during the visits of the Swedish-Norwegian royal family to Norway. 

Presently, the "overhoffmesterinne" in Norway acts as a vice hostess at the Norwegian royal court when the queen and the other female members of the royal family are absent.





In 1722, the Russian Imperial court was reorganized in accordance with the reforms of Peter the Great to Westernize Russia, and the old court offices of the Tsarina was replaced with court offices inspired by the German model. Accordingly, the new principal lady in waiting of the Russian empress was named 
"Ober-Hofmeisterin".

In Sweden, the Chief Court Mistress is the second highest-ranking official of the royal household, preceded only by the <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Realm%20%28Sweden%29">Marshal of the Realm</a>. She ranks immediately below the members of the <a href="Swedish%20Royal%20Family">royal family</a>, the <a href="speaker%20of%20the%20Parliament%20of%20Sweden">speaker of the Parliament</a> and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Sweden">prime minister</a>, and has precedence over former speakers of the Parliament and former prime ministers. The incumbent is <a href="Alice%20Trolle-Wachtmeister">Countess Alice Trolle-Wachtmeister</a>, who has served since 1994.

The title and position have changed over time. Before the reign of <a href="Queen%20Christina%20of%20Sweden">Queen Christina</a> (1632–1654), the title was generally referred to as "hovmästarinna" (Court Mistress), but during and after the reign of Christina, it became the custom to have two such Court mistresses subordinate to one "överhovmästarinna" (Chief Court Mistress). Only the Queen and the Queen Dowager had a Chief Court Mistress called "överhovmästarinna" (the Chief Court Mistress) while the equivalent at the courts of other female members of the royal house was called "hovmästarinna" (Court Mistress). 

The position was the highest a female courtier could have in the Swedish royal court, and the "överhovmästarinna" was ranked an <a href="Excellency">Excellency</a>, something unusual for a woman in the 17th century, which placed her immediately after the female members of the royal house in rank. Her role was to uphold etiquette at court, and receive and carry out the instructions of the Queen in the management of the court. She managed the employment of new members to the court of the Queen, and every meeting and letter to the Queen passed through her. She also managed the ceremony of the court presentation, in which nobles were presented to the royal family and thus allowed to show themselves officially at court. She could also represent the Queen on some occasions at court ceremonies and parties as hostess.

Eleanor C. Lambertsen (1916 – March 30, 1998) was an American nurse. She was noted for a dissertation called "Nursing Team Organization and Functioning" which was later published as a book. Lambertsen's concept revolutionized nursing's and health care's organization and delivery. She received several awards for her achievements, and was inducted into the <a href="American%20Nurses%20Association%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Nurses Association Hall of Fame</a> in 2012.

Lambertsen was born in 1916 in <a href="Fanwood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fanwood, New Jersey</a>. She had two brothers. Lambertsen began her career in nursing in the 1930s, working as a bedside nurse while studying at <a href="Overlook%20Medical%20Center">Overlook Hospital</a>. She graduated from the hospital in 1938. Lambertsen was named the school's director of its nursing department five years later, and became its acting director in 1946. She earned a bachelor of science degree in 1949, later a bachelor's in the following year, and became a Doctor of Education in 1957 from <a href="Teachers%20College%2C%20Columbia%20University">Teachers College, Columbia University</a>. Her dissertation brought forward an idea of team nursing called "Nursing Team Organization and Functioning." It was published as a book by <a href="Teachers%20College%20Press">Teachers College Press</a> in 1953. The result led to Lambertsen leading a dissertation project at <a href="Francis%20Delafield%23Francis%20Delafield%20Hospital">Francis Delafield Hospital</a> which attracted many hospital administrators from across the United States who wanted to pursue the reorganization of their staff.

Her plan called for registered nurses to work closer with doctors to oversee the care of patients and set treatment goals and to coordinate the roles of nurses. Lambertsen was named as the <a href="American%20Hospital%20Association">American Hospital Association</a>'s (AHA) first director of the division of nursing in 1958. While at AHA, she also served as the organization's assistant secretary of professional practices. Lambertsen later became Teachers College's director of their division of nursing between 1961 and 1968. She was made their director of all health services in the same year. Lambersen was appointed dean of <a href="Cornell%20School%20of%20Nursing">Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing</a> in 1970, and was made their senior associate director four years later. That same year, she became the first nurse to serve on the board Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, where she remained for the next 12 years. Lambersen later served as the board's vice-chairman between 1981 and 1986.

She held various positions and had influence to a large variety of organizations, where Lambersten was heavily involved in developing some of nursing's most important advances. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Lambersten managed a consulting business which served to broaden nursing education across the globe. she had also been on the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>'s expert advisory council on nursing from 1961 to 1982. From 1963 to 1975, she was the <a href="Visiting%20Nurse%20Service%20of%20New%20York">Visiting Nurse Service of New York</a>'s director, and served as chairwoman of the New York State Nurses Association Council of Research in Nursing between 1972 and 1976. She died on March 30, 1998 in a nursing home in <a href="Gladwyne%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gladwyne, Pennsylvania</a>, and was preceded in death by her husband Joseph Anderson. On November 3, a memoral service for Lambertsen was held at the <a href="Weill%20Cornell%20Medicine">Weill Medical College of Cornell University</a>.

One of Lambertsen's students described her as "a champion of advanced practice who was willing to stand up to the power structure with determination and grit." Her influence allowed generations of clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners to independently practice their workload. Her concept to team nursing revolutionized nursing's organization and delivery of nursing and health care. 

Lambertsen received several honors and awards during her lifetime. She was a recipient of the R. Louise McManus Award from the Nursing Education Alumni Association at Teachers College. Lambersten garnered honorary recognition from the <a href="American%20Nursing%20Association">American Nursing Association</a> and the New York State Nurses Association, and gained membership to the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Medicine">National Academy of Medicine</a>; she was made an honorary fellow of the AHA. In 1989, she was inducted into the Health Care Hall of Fame. Lambertsen was inducted into the <a href="American%20Nurses%20Association%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Nurses Association Hall of Fame</a> in 2012.

Hawley's Ferry House

The Hawley's Ferry House, also known just as the Hawley House, is a historic house on the shore of <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> in <a href="Kingsland%20Bay%20State%20Park">Kingsland Bay State Park</a>, <a href="Ferrisburgh%2C%20Vermont">Ferrisburgh, Vermont</a>. Built about 1790, it is one of the few surviving 18th-century buildings on the Vermont side of the lake. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1978.

Kingsland Bay is a north-facing inlet on the east side of Lake Champlain, at a point where the lake briefly bends eastward. The bay is flanked by Hurlburt Point to the west and Macdonough Point to the east, both of which are contained in Kingsland Bay State Park, a day-use facility operated by the state. The Hawley House is located on the west side of Macdonough Point, where most of the park facilities are located. It is a 2-1/2 story gable-roofed structure, built out of local stone. Its walls are fairly uniformly thick. It is five bays wide and three deep, with a central hall plan. A three story tower stands at the northeast corner, added about 1900.

The house was built about 1790 by Gideon Hawley, one of Ferrisburgh's first settlers. At the time, there were no roads in the area, and commerce on the lake was of vital importance. Hawley began operating a ferry across the lake about that time, which operated until about 1830. By then, roads had been built, to which much commerce moved, and the orientation of lake traffic became more north-south. Macdonough Point was an important militia muster site during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> in advance of the important <a href="Battle%20of%20Plattsburgh">Battle of Plattsburgh</a>. The building was used for many years as a farmhouse by local families, and was converted for use as a girls summer camp called Ecole Champlain about 1924. That property was acquired by the state and became the core of the state park in the 1970s.

Elektro-Apparate-Werke

The Elektro-Apparate-Werke (EAW) was a state-owned industrial operation of the <a href="German%20Democratic%20Republic">German Democratic Republic</a> (DDR, East Germany). It was a successor of the combine VEB "Elektro-Apparate-Werke" (VEB) and, with more than 8000 employees, was one of the largest manufacturers of electrical appliances in the DDR.

The site of the former headquarters in the Berlin suburb of <a href="Alt-Treptow">Alt-Treptow</a> is since 1998 the location of the <a href="Treptowers">Treptowers</a>, the Berlin offices of <a href="Allianz%20SE">Allianz SE</a>.

EAW originated from the "Apparate-Werken Berlin-Treptow (AT)", founded by <a href="AEG">AEG</a> in 1928. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> the company "manufactured radio equipment for bombers and <a href="U-boats">U-boats</a> and navigational devices for [<a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2 rockets</a>]. Its factory [was] largely destroyed by Allied bombing raids", EAM was taken over as a Soviet Aktiengesellschaft (SAG) on October 21, 1946, and renamed "Elektro-Apparate-Werke Berlin-Treptow" (EAW). After the death of <a href="Stalin">Stalin</a> the company was renamed the "Elektro-Apparate-Werke J. W. Stalin.". On December 31, 1953 the works changed their legal form from SAG to a nationally-owned company ("volkseigener betrieb") In 1960 as part of <a href="De-Stalinization">De-Stalinization</a> the name was changed to "VEB EAW Berlin-Treptow "<a href="Friedrich%20Ebert">Friedrich Ebert</a>"", after the former socialist president of Germany. In the 1980s a memorial plaque was installed at the administration building for communist athlete <a href="Werner%20Seelenbinder">Werner Seelenbinder</a>.

EAW also led the polytechnic training of students of neighboring schools in Treptow. The class in "Productive Work" was taught through a practical project. The water tower at the <a href="Ostkreuz">Ostkreuz</a> station was in a poorly maintained hut with heating problems during the cold season. The project taught the theory of socialist production and practical solutions of production tasks. Practical student work included the construction of indoor fountains for the people's use. A second location for the "Productive work" lessons was the Karl Kunger Street in Treptow.

For the qualification of the employees, the EAW maintained a training school, also in Karl Kunger Street. There sales skills were taught with a focus on vocational qualification. Also annual refreshers were held for monotonous tasks of unskilled people, as in the production of refrigerator relays.

Compulsory physical education of two hours per week for the entire staff took place in company facilities inside and on the outdoor grass and gravel courts in Baumschulenweg. Also the various sports associations met there (notably the handball association) and weekly sports instruction took place.

The EAW was also a workplace and rehabilitation site for prisoners who were incarcerated nearby at the Rummelsburg prison, not far from the relay factory on Hoffmannstraße.

In 1990, following German reunification, the organization was transformed into "EAW Berlin GmbH", and was privatized in 1993. Unfortunately the company was burdened with excess employees, and a line of dated, expensive, and unreliable products. Attempts to diversify into consumer electronics and build products that could compete in the world market failed. In 1990 the organization was transformed into "EAW Berlin GmbH", and was privatized in 1993. From the former organization independent mid-sized enterprises emerged. The EAW vocational school closed in the early 1990s.

EAM manufactured measuring instruments, rectifiers, relays, circuit breakers, vacuum switches, instrumentation and control engineering, electric meters, radios, and computers. EAW was the manufacturer of power system distance protection equipmeent in East Germany. The last consumer products were the EAW AUDIO 145 stereo radio cassette recorder, the SKR 701 stereo cassette recorder, and the <a href="P8000">P8000</a> <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>, based on the East German "U8000" clone of the <a href="Zilog%20Z8000">Zilog Z8000</a>, running a Unix clone called WEGA.

She attended a UK Sport Talent Day, and began playing for a local club in <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, the Otters in 2007, as a <a href="4%20point%20player">4 point player</a>. The <a href="Lord%27s%20Taverners">Lord's Taverners</a> gave her a £2,000 custom-made wheelchair basketball chair. in 2009, she made her international debut at the <a href="Paralympic%20World%20Cup">Paralympic World Cup</a>.

Stratton's Inn

Stratton's Inn is a historic house on East Street in <a href="Brookfield%2C%20Vermont">Brookfield, Vermont</a>. Built in the late 1790s as a tavern located at the junction of two locally important roads, it is a fine example of Federal period architecture, most importantly preserving the inn's original tap room. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1982.

Stratton's Inn stands in what is now a remote and rural area of northeastern Brookfield, on the west side of East Street. Just north of the house is a broad bend in the road, from which a former turnpike right-of-way is still discernible, heading southeast. The former inn is a two story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, large central chimney, clapboarded exterior, and stone foundation. The principal entrance is on the east-facing facade, which is five bays wide. The entrance is framed by slender Federal period pilasters, and is topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. Similar but less elaborate entrances are also found on the south and west sides. A 20th-century three-bay garage is attached at a setback on the south side. The interior of the house follows a fairly typical early Federal central-chimney plan, with a narrow entry vestibule with winding staircase in front of chimney, large chambers on either side, and a long chamber behind. The northern chamber was originally finished as a parlor, while the southern one was the tap room. Near the entrance to the vestibule is a closet, providing access to storage under the stairs, from which it is surmised the tavern host dispensed drinks.

The inn was most likely built sometime between 1795 and 1798 by Ebenezer Stratton, one of Brookfield's first settlers. It was located along what was known as Paine's Turnpike, a major north-south route. It is possible that a sign labelled "E. Stratton's", found in the <a href="Smithsonian%20Museum%20of%20American%20History">Smithsonian Museum of American History</a>, originally hung here. The property served as a stagecoach stop at least until 1838, and remained in the hands of Stratton's descendants until 1890, operated mainly as a farm.

Première dame d'honneur

Première dame d'honneur ('First lady of honour'), or only "dame d'honneur" ('lady of honour'), was an office at the royal court of France. It existed in nearly all French courts from the 16th-century onward. Though the task of the post shifted, the dame d'honneur was normally the first or the second rank of all ladies-in-waiting. The dame d'honneur was selected from the members of the highest <a href="French%20nobility">French nobility</a>. 

The office was created in 1523.
The task of the dame d'honneur was to supervise the female courtiers, controlling the budget, ordering necessary purchases, and organizing the annual account and staff list; she supervised the daily routine, and attended ordinary as well as ceremonial court functions, as well as escorting and introducing those seeking audience with the queen. She had the keys to the queen's personal rooms in her possession. 

When the dame d'honneur was absent, she was replaced by the "<a href="dame%20d%27atour">dame d'atour</a>", who normally had the responsibility of the queen's wardrobe and jewelry and the dressing of the queen. 

In 1619, the office of the "<a href="Surintendante%20de%20la%20Maison%20de%20la%20Reine">Surintendante de la Maison de la Reine</a>", or only "surintendante", was created. The surintendante had about the same tasks as the dame d'honneur: receiving the oath of the female personnel before they took office and supervising them and the queens daily routine, as well as organizing the accounts and staff list, but she was placed in rank above the dame d'honneur. Whenever the surintendante was absent, she was replaced by the dame d'honneur. The post of surintendante could be left vacant for long periods, such as between the death of <a href="Marie%20Anne%20de%20Bourbon%20%281697%E2%80%931741%29">Marie Anne de Bourbon</a> in 1741 and the appointment of <a href="Princess%20Marie%20Louise%20of%20Savoy">Princess Marie Louise of Savoy</a> in 1775. 

The term dame d'honneur has also been use as a term for a French lady-in-waiting in general. From 1523, the group of ladies-in-waiting attending the court as companions of the queen had the title dame d'honneur (commonly only 'dame'), hence the title 'Première dame d'honneur' ('First lady of honur') to distinguish between the chief lady in waiting and the remaining (married) ladies-in-waiting. In 1674, however, a reform replaced both the common married dame d'honneur or dames as well as the unmarried filles d'honneur ('maid of honour') or filles with the "dame de palais". 

The position of dame d'honneur was revived during the First Empire, were the principal lady-in-waiting to the empress had the same title.

During the Second Empire, the dame d'honneur had the same position as before, now formally second rank below a surintendante with the title "Grande-Maitresse".







For the first years in France, before her Spanish entourage was sent back to Spain, Anne had both a French and a Spanish office holder in several posts of her court.

Caribbeing

Caribbeing is a film aesthetic developed by <a href="Trinidad%20%26amp%3B%20Tobago">Trinidad & Tobago</a> <a href="film%20director">film director</a>, <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a> and film lecturer <a href="Yao%20Ramesar">Yao Ramesar</a>. The genesis of the term is circa 1970 when, while travelling with his family on the Federal Maple (a West Indian inter-island ferry), Ramesar coined the term in relation to how some of the other passengers pronounced the word 'Caribbean'. In his eventual film career, he applied the term 'Caribbeing' to describe his trademark cinematic aesthetic. Additionally, the name 'Caribbeing' became both the title of a 9-minute short which he made in 1995, and the name of his company.

In an article entitled Ramesar’s vision of 'Caribbeing' Haiti, Yao explained the genesis of Caribbeing: I noticed in some islands Caribbean was pronounced ‘Caribbeing’ and I started calling the region this. The Caribbeing aesthetic came about because I wanted to develop a cinema language that would represent the light, the landscape, the people and the sounds of the geo-political Caribbean through its own prism, and not laundered by Hollywood.

In a 2015 article, Yao explains: In 'Caribbeing' – I use the words centrifugal because you remember the times when the European believed that somehow the planets revolved around the earth... the Caribbean sun, as such, is a centrifugal force and aesthetic, in our films – it has to be... light is the main spirit in cinema... the idea of Caribbeing [incorporates my] new terminology of the 'eyelect', the visual dialect, the things that we see without eyes.

Caribbeing almost always contains one or more of the following elements:


In 1995, during the <a href="Carifesta">Carifesta</a> VI Film & Video Festival held in Trinidad, Yao premiered a 9-minute short entitled 'Caribbeing'. Utilizing his Caribbeing aesthetic, this short film explored the <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> being of Caribbean people, beyond the influence of <a href="cable">cable</a> and <a href="satellite%20television">satellite television</a>. During the <a href="Carifesta%20VI">Carifesta VI</a> symposium on Cultural Technology held in Trinidad, Yao delivered the paper 'CARIBBEING: Cultural Imperatives & The Technology of Motion Picture Production'). This paper explored Yao's concept of Caribbeing and the existence of Caribbean peoples on the spiritual plane. In addition, Yao hosted a Caribbeing photo exhibition, where the subjects of his photographs (mainly women) were shot using natural and available light.

In 2013, Yao Ramesar announced the establishment of a Caribbeing Award to commemorate the work of Caribbean nationals and recognize the impact of an individual or group on the arts within the Caribbean space. This award, which was bestowed the following year, will be granted biennially with the first award celebrating an individual or group for work in intellectual property law).

In 2015, Yao Ramesar launched his official website, TheReelCaribbeing.com), and a supplemental <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page). Available on the website is production information on three of Ramesar's recent feature films: "<a href="SistaGod">SistaGod</a>" (2006), "SistaGod II: Her Second Coming (2009) and "<a href="Haiti%20Bride">Haiti Bride</a>".

<doc id="51576294" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51576294" title="Sandhurst War Memorial">
Sandhurst War Memorial

Sandhurst War Memorial is a <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">First World War memorial</a> in the village of <a href="Sandhurst%2C%20Kent">Sandhurst</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, south-eastern England, close to the border with <a href="East%20Sussex">East Sussex</a>. The memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> and arguably the one with the most elaborate setting. It was unveiled in 1923 and is today a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens designed <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London, which became the focus for the national <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> commemorations, as well as the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a>—the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world—and the <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> which appears in all large <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. Sandhurst's memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses by Lutyens, all of which share a broadly similar design.

Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, Lutyens established his reputation by designing country houses for wealthy clients; many of Lutyens' commissions for war memorials originated with pre-war friends and clients. In the case of Sandhurst, it appears Lutyens had a close personal friendship with a local resident, James Wilson.

The village established a war memorial committee, which was chaired by Mr Herbert Alexander and chose a site on Goddards Green in the centre of the village, in front of the village's clock tower, which dates from 1889.

The memorial consists of a <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> cross to Lutyens' War Cross design, with a tapering shaft and short arms moulded close to the top, with a sword and a <a href="laurel%20wreath">laurel wreath</a> in <a href="relief%20carving">relief carving</a>. The cross sits on a plinth of three rectangular stone blocks and a base of two shallow stone steps. The dedication is inscribed on the top section of the plinth: "TO THE BRAVE MEN OF SANDHURST WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE GREAT WARS" (the "s" added later in tribute to the dead from the Second World War); the middle section bears the dates of the First World War and the names of the village's fallen. The dates of the Second World War and the names of the fallen from that conflict were later added to the bottom section. The whole memorial sits on a base of a single shallow step (rather than the three steps commonly found at other Lutyens memorials).

The setting is one of the most elaborate for Lutyens' war memorials. The clock tower rises behind the cross on its main axis, while parallel strips of Portland stone leading out from each side of the base form a large cross in the grass. The tip and arms are terminated by stone benches, while the foot is terminated by a circular flower bed, which is itself bordered by Portland stone.

The memorial was unveiled in August 1923 by <a href="George%20Goschen%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Goschen">George Goschen, 2nd Viscount Goschen</a>.

Sandhurst War Memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> on 5 July 1993. In November 2015, as part of the commemorations of the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens's war memorials were recognised as a "national collection" and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> list entries were updated and expanded.

Mohamed Gueddiche (born 25 July 1942) is a <a href="Tunisia">Tunisian</a> <a href="Cardiology">cardiologist</a>. He also holds a senior military rank.

Mohamed Gueddiche was born in <a href="Hammamet%2C%20Tunisia">Hammamet</a>, a coastal town in the <a href="Nabeul%20Governorate">Nabeul Governorate</a> of northeastern Tunisia.

Surintendante de la Maison de la Reine

Surintendante de la Maison de la Reine, or only "Surintendante", was the senior <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> at the royal court of France from 1619 until the French revolution. The "Surintendante" was selected from the members of the highest <a href="French%20nobility">French nobility</a>. 

The office was created in 1619. 
The Surintendante and the "<a href="Governess%20of%20the%20Children%20of%20France">Governess of the Children of France</a>" were the only female office holders in France to give an oath of loyalty to the King himself. 

The surintendante had about the same tasks as the "<a href="dame%20d%27honneur">dame d'honneur</a>": receiving the oath of the female personnel before they took office and supervising them and the queens daily routine, as well as organizing the accounts and staff list, but she was placed in rank above the dame d'honneur. Whenever the surintendante was absent, she was replaced by the dame d'honneur. The post of surintendante could be left vacant for long periods, and was abolished between the death of <a href="Marie%20Anne%20de%20Bourbon%20%281697%E2%80%931741%29">Marie Anne de Bourbon</a> in 1741 and the appointment of <a href="Princess%20Marie%20Louise%20of%20Savoy">Princess Marie Louise of Savoy</a> in 1775. 

During the Second Empire, the "Grande-Maitresse" was the equivalent of the Surintendante, being formally the highest female official at court but in practice with the same tasks as the dame d'honneur.

<doc id="51576527" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51576527" title="Design for Inspection">
Design for Inspection

Design for Inspection (DFI) is an engineering principle that proposes that inspection methods and <a href="measurement%20instruments">measurement instruments</a> used to certify manufacturing conformity, should be considered early in the design of products. Production processes should be designed in such a way that features of the product are easy to inspect with readily available measurement instruments, and so that <a href="measurement%20uncertainty">measurement uncertainty</a> is considered in the tolerance that are applied. The concept can be applied in almost all engineering disciplines. DFI describes the process of designing or engineering a product in order to facilitate the measurement in order to reduce the overall costs of manufacturing and delivering products that satisfy customers.

The role of <a href="inspection">inspection</a> in the manufacturing process is to ensure that the manufacturing process is producing components that meet the specification requirements. Inspection does not assure the quality of the product, only a robust and repeatable manufacturing process can achieve this. Therefore, inspection is often considered as an overhead although an extremely important one. Similar to <a href="Design%20for%20Manufacture">Design for Manufacture</a> (DFM) and <a href="Design%20for%20Assembly">Design for Assembly</a> (DFA) (which seek to avoid designs which are difficult to make), the concept of Design for Inspection (DFI) considers measurement capabilities at an early stage in the product development life cycle and uses knowledge of the fundamental principles of <a href="metrology">metrology</a> to achieve cost reduction. If the inspection method and instruments are considered and selected at the design stage, the likelihood that a tolerance feature cannot be inspected or requires a specialised instrument is substantially reduced. High precision features require specialised manufacturing and metrology, these can have limited availability in the supply chain and therefore often have increased cost. The concept of DFI should complement and work in collaboration with <a href="DFM">DFM</a> and <a href="DFA">DFA</a>. There are three key areas when considering DFI, datum selection, tolerances and accessibility, plus general metrology considerations. Getting the most from inspection techniques will help improve quality. It is still difficult for systems designers to build machines that allow finished products to be inspected easily. To do so requires an understanding of the product being manufactured and how inspection tasks can improve the quality control process.

Inspection can represent a significant percentage of an existing product's manufacturing cost. DFI may naturally be called for in redesign of a product to reduce that cost component when it is high. However, DFI will not always reduce inspection costs: it can also lead to increased rate of inspection, because more convenient or higher quality measurement may justify increasing measurements, say from a sampling rate satisfactory to support a basic level of tolerance to a higher rate (e.g. to 100%). Or DFI may make it economical for 100% inspections to measure more features or to make repeated measures of the same feature at different points within the manufacturing process. This would be justified if it would reduce internal failure costs (such as costs of rework or scrap) or external failure costs (such as customer returns) within the <a href="cost%20of%20quality">cost of quality</a> framework.

Frederick Sherwood Dunn

Frederick Sherwood Dunn (June 10, 1893 – March 17, 1962) was an American scholar of <a href="international%20law">international law</a> and <a href="international%20relations">international relations</a>. After working as a legal officer at the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. Department of State</a>, he went into academia and taught at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>, <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, and <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, publishing several books during his career. He served as a founder and a director of both Yale's <a href="Yale%20Institute%20of%20International%20Studies">Institute of International Studies</a> and the <a href="Center%20of%20International%20Studies">Center of International Studies</a> at Princeton.

Dunn was born in New York City on June 10, 1893, to parents George Warren Dunn and the former Sarah Benton Brown. He graduated from the <a href="Kelvin%20School">Kelvin School</a>, a preparatory school for boys in Manhattan, in 1910. He then went to <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, from where he graduated in 1914 with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Letters">Bachelor of Letters</a> degree, followed by the <a href="New%20York%20University%20School%20of%20Law">New York University School of Law</a>, from where he earned a <a href="Doctor%20of%20law">Doctor of law</a> degree in 1917. 

He was admitted to the bar in 1917 but during that year entered the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, in which he served until 1919. With the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">American Expeditionary Forces</a> in France, he was a <a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Tank%20Corps%20of%20the%20American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">AEF Tank Corps</a>.

Upon returning to the United States, Dunn began practicing law in Washington, D.C., in 1920. He worked as a legal officer at the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. Department of State</a>, where his positions included being an Assistant Solicitor, an associate counsel in American and British Claims Arbitration, and a lawyer for United States agent before the Mixed Claims Commission (United States and Mexico).

In 1922, Dunn married the former Gordon Woodbury; they had two children but she died in 1929. He was known as Ted Dunn to friends.

While in State Department positions, two of which involved international claims commissions, Dunn began thinking about the factors behind how the claims were decided and how they often went beyond legal considerations. He studied international law at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>, in part supported by a <a href="Carnegie%20Fellowship">Carnegie Fellowship</a>, and earned a Ph.D. there in 1928. 

Between 1928 and 1933 Dunn published three influential books (the first of which was based on his dissertation), as well as several articles, on the sociological aspect of international jurisprudence.

Dunn was the Creswell Lecturer on International Law at Johns Hopkins from 1929 to 1935 and during the same period was also executive secretary of the <a href="Walter%20Hines%20Page%20School%20of%20International%20Relations">Walter Hines Page School of International Relations</a> at the same university.

In 1935, Dunn went to <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, where he became a professor of international relations. At the same time he was a co-founder of the <a href="Yale%20Institute%20of%20International%20Studies">Yale Institute of International Studies</a> along with <a href="Nicholas%20J.%20Spykman">Nicholas J. Spykman</a>, the new entity's first director, and <a href="Arnold%20Wolfers">Arnold Wolfers</a>. Dunn's own investigations broadened greatly in scope from his earlier work but he still applied the perspective he had developed studying international law to issues of world politics.

Dunn became the director of the institute in 1940, when Spykman fell ill, and held that post through 1951. From this point on, his administrative and project roles took priority over his own research and writing. 
Under Dunn, the institute had a loose, informal organization. It focused on work that would clarify choices faced by American foreign policy and determine ways in which American power could best be deployed. Dunn urged institute members to write with clarity and to keep their books short.
Journalist <a href="Fred%20Kaplan%20%28journalist%29">Fred Kaplan</a> has written, "In the 1940s, there was no more exciting and stimulating place in the academic world for an international relations scholar to reside than at the Institute of International Studies at Yale."

During 1948 and 1949 Dunn was a U.S. delegate to <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> general conferences in Beirut and Paris.

In 1949 Dunn remarried, to the former Mary Beale Willard, and gained two step-children.

During 1950–51, the Yale Institute of International Studies ran into a conflict with the new President of Yale University, <a href="Alfred%20Whitney%20Griswold">A. Whitney Griswold</a>, who felt that scholars should conduct research as individuals rather than in cooperative groups and who thought that the institute should do more historical, detached analysis rather than focus on current issues and recommendations on policy. In addition there was some personal animosity involved, related to Griswold believing that institute members had argued against his receiving tenure.

In April 1951, Dunn and five of his political science colleagues – Percy Corbett, <a href="Gabriel%20Almond">Gabriel Almond</a>, Klaus Knorr, <a href="William%20Kaufmann">William Kaufmann</a>, and <a href="Bernard%20Cecil%20Cohen">Bernard C. Cohen</a> – left Yale "en masse" and went to Princeton. With the goal of strengthening international studies within the <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson%20School%20of%20Public%20and%20International%20Affairs">Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs</a> at that university, the <a href="Center%20of%20International%20Studies">Center of International Studies</a> was created. The news of the shift from Yale to Princeton made the front page of the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>"; the new center became known as the continuation of the old institute, with one government publication later terming it a "reincarnation". The President of Princeton, <a href="Harold%20W.%20Dodds">Harold W. Dodds</a>, used a metaphor from <a href="American%20football">American football</a> to summarize the events: "Yale fumbled and Princeton recovered the ball." One statement written after Dunn's passing said of him, "Beneath a quiet, unassuming manner, Frederick Dunn 
maintained unyielding firmness in acts of whose rightness he 
was convinced. It is believed that his transfer of the Center 
from Yale to Princeton was an instance of this."

In addition to being director of the center, Dunn was named the Albert G. Milbank Professor of International Law and Practice at Princeton. Dunn's later scholarly work included a focus on decision-making and some of the self-deceptions made by Foreign Offices: in particular, he stated that people often thought they were finding a solution to a technical problem when in actuality they were making a political choice.

During his career Dunn also served as a trustee for the <a href="Carnegie%20Endowment%20for%20International%20Peace">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a>, was the chair of the board of editors of the quarterly academic journal "<a href="World%20Politics">World Politics</a>", which had been founded at the Yale institute, and did consulting work for the <a href="RAND%20Corporation">RAND Corporation</a>. He was also a twenty-year member of the <a href="Century%20Association">Century Association</a>.

Dunn retired from Princeton in July 1961. He did teach a seminar in politics at <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a> during the fall of that year, while continuing to reside in Princeton. 

He died on March 17, 1962, at the <a href="Hospital%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania Hospital</a>'s neurological unit. 
His final book, "Peace-making and the Settlement with Japan", was published posthumously in 1963.

One of his colleagues, <a href="William%20T.%20R.%20Fox">William T. R. Fox</a>, noted that Dunn's legacy could be seen in how the Yale Institute of International Studies became a model for other international relations research entities to follow, including the Princeton center, <a href="Arnold%20A.%20Saltzman%20Institute%20of%20War%20and%20Peace%20Studies">Columbia University's Institute of War and Peace Studies</a>, the <a href="MIT%20Center%20for%20International%20Studies">MIT Center for International Studies</a>, and the <a href="Washington%20Center%20of%20Foreign%20Policy%20Research">Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research</a> at Johns Hopkins, and that all four were initially led by colleagues of Dunn at Yale.

Jeanne Bouvier

Jeanne Bouvier (11 February 1865 - 1964) was remembered as a French textile worker, feminist and militant <a href="trade%20union">trade unionist</a>.

Born in 1865 in <a href="Salaise-sur-Sanne">Salaise-sur-Sanne</a>, <a href="Is%C3%A8re">Isère</a>, she was the daughter of Marcel Bouvier and Louise Grenouiller. The family moved to <a href="Saint-Rambert-d%27Albon">Saint-Rambert-d'Albon</a>, <a href="Dr%C3%B4me">Drôme</a>, when Bouvier was 16 months old. She had a sister and there was a brother who died of measles. As a child, Bouvier helped her mother work in the fields and guard the cows. At the age of ten years, Bouvier was sent to board at a religious school in <a href="%C3%89pinouze">Épinouze</a> where she was a good student. A year later, the family moved again and settled in <a href="Saint-Symphorien-d%27Ozon">Saint-Symphorien-d'Ozon</a>, <a href="Rh%C3%B4ne">Rhône</a>, and she became a silk factory worker. 

After 1840 it was illegal for French children under the age of 12 to work more than an eight hour day, but Bouvier worked in one of the many factories that ignored the law and she would work thirteen hours. The wages were poor and she and her mother would go without food. Her mother would blame her for being so lazy that her employers did not pay her more. Bouvier changed employers to get better wages and the family moved several times, with Bouvier specializing in textile work. 

Bouvier was appointed technical advisor and served as an active delegate to the first International Congress of Workers at the first <a href="International%20Labour%20Conference">International Labour Conference</a> held in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in 1919.

From 1919 to 1935, she was a member of the Joint Committee for Unemployment Fund. In April 1922, after 27 years of affiliation, she was forced to leave the union.

Kito de Boer

Kito de Boer (born April 29, 1957) is a Dutch consultant, former senior McKinsey director and diplomat now serving as Head of Mission of the Office of the Quartet. <a href="Quartet%20on%20the%20Middle%20East">The Quartet</a> is a foursome of nations, international and supranational entities that mediates between Israelis and Palestinians. The Quartet comprises the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and Russia.
The Office of the Quartet, located in East Jerusalem, is mandated to take "tangible steps on the ground to advance the Palestinian economy and preserve the possibility of a two solution." As head, de Boer leads on the Office of the Quartet's strategy on Palestinian economic and institutional empowerment, including matters concerning rule of law and economic development, as well as movement and access.

de Boer was born in Venezuela and educated in England. He earned a Bsc in Management Sciences from Loughborough University and an MBA from Cranfield School of Management.

Early in his career, de Boer worked for Shell Netherlands, and Burroughs Computers in Rancho Bernado, Calif., and in Detroit, Mich. He worked for Electrolux S.E. Asia, and was based in Singapore. He joined McKinsey & Co. in London in 1985.
In 1992, he went to New Delhi as one of five partners who were a "landing party" for the consulting firm. He helped found the Delhi office, was location manager and headed the consumer goods and retail practice in India. During his time in India, he was elected senior partner.

In 2000, he moved to <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a> to found the consulting firm's Middle East practice. In 2009, he became the leader of McKinsey's Public and Social Sector practice in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where he was responsible for McKinsey’s work for governments and non-profits. From 2012, still based in Dubai, Kito also co-led the McKinsey Center for Government, a global hub for research and innovation in government performance.
Journalist Frank Kane, writing in "The National", said de Boer counted as confidants many of the most powerful political and business leaders in the world.

de Boer, working as a consultant for <a href="The%20Portland%20Trust">The Portland Trust</a>, developed a plan for growth for $13 billion GDP Palestinian economy. On April 24, 2014, at a State Department event, Secretary of State John Kerry and then Quartet Representative <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> appointed de Boer Head of Mission with a specific mandate to implement the Initiative of the Palestinian Economy. In June 2015, Tony Blair stepped aside as Quartet Representative. de Boer has given several interviews about his role, including one with the YPO, in which he said the two-state solution is the only viable solution.

de Boer and his wife, Jane Gowers, are noted collectors of Indian art. Their collection, located in New Delhi, London and Dubai and numbering about 1,000 pieces, is one of the largest and most varied collections of modern Indian art in private hands, according to the introduction to a book on the collection by Giles Tilloston titled "Modern Indian Painting: From The De Boer Collection". The collection includes works by <a href="Ganesh%20Pyne">Ganesh Pyne</a>, Rameshwar Broota, <a href="S.%20H.%20Raza">S. H.

de Boer has said he and Gowers collected the art by "a process that is not complicated, just nine words: one object at a time with love and responsibility. ... Collectors are not interesting, the collections are. But if you do an autopsy on the collection then perhaps you can learn about the psychology behind the process of collecting."

8-Bit Hordes

8-Bit Hordes is a simplistic <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> video game developed by <a href="Petroglyph%20Games">Petroglyph Games</a>, which was released on 12 August 2016 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. The game is noted for its unique graphic style combined with the gameplay of classic strategy games like "<a href="Warcraft%202">Warcraft 2</a>". It is uses the same engine as its predecessor <a href="8-Bit%20Armies">8-Bit Armies</a>, but is now based in a <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> themed scenario.

"8-Bit Hordes" is the sequel to the game "<a href="8-Bit%20Armies">8-Bit Armies</a>". It uses the same engine and interface. After the release of "8-Bit Armies", Petroglyph Games wanted to release more factions via DLC, but then decided to make an entire spin-off, which led to the release of "8-Bit Hordes" a few months later on 12 August 2016. Due their similarities, both games offer various cross-over functionalities.

"8-Bit Hordes" is a real time strategy game designed to mirror the look and gameplay of classic RTS games of the 90s. It features a singleplayer campaign and a multiplayer mode in which players battle each other or the AI in the <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative game mode</a>. The game takes a very simplistic approach in its gameplay and graphical elements. The graphic features a blocky 8-bit retro-art voxel style with partially destructible terrain. Gameplay is very similar to the classic "<a href="Warcraft">Warcraft</a>" franchise. The player starts with a castle building which he uses to expand his base so he can build various military units to fight his opponents. Resources are gathered via lorries which gather gold from nearby mines to the main castle. Units and buildings are built via a clickable menu on the right side of the screen, similar to the <a href="Command%20and%20Conquer">Command and Conquer</a> franchise. The players have to build farms to provide upkeep for their forces. The game is situated in a generic fantasy scenario featuring orcs, dwarfs, mages or dragon units. Featured in the game are 2 factions, the "good" "Lightbringers" and the "bad" "Deathsworn".

The game also features cross-game multiplayer battles with "8-Bit Armies" players, allowing them to play against each other with all factions from both games. This is even possible when the player only owns one of the two games.

"8-Bit Hordes" was released digitally on 12 August 2016 on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> as well <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a>. The reception of the game was mixed to positive. Reviewers acknowledged the game as a homage to the classic "Warcraft" franchise, with a similar simplistic gameplay approach and a classic retro graphic style. The classic RTS gameplay has been praised as the core strength of the game.
Some reviews criticised the lack of variety: the campaign features no distinctive story line and the gameplay may feel repetitive, as simple aggressive <a href="Rush%20%28video%20gaming%29">rush</a> tactics usual lead to a fast victory. The lopsided AI opponents which are merely just enough for warm-up play as well as sometimes bad pathfinding were additional criticised points. It has also been noted that the game is essentially a reskinned version of "8-Bit Armies", now with dragons instead of tanks. The soundtrack, which has been composed by former "Command & Conquer" composer <a href="Frank%20Klepacki">Frank Klepacki</a>, has been described positively. As conclusion, reviews described the game as a nostalgic flashback which falls short in variety and long-time motivation, but still manages to make fun for a short while.

The site is situated in piedmont steppes above the Zhalgyzagash River, a tributary of the <a href="Koksu%20River">Koksu River</a>. The people of Begash were <a href="transhumant">transhumant</a> pastoralists who mainly herded sheep and goats. They likely used the site primarily as a place of winter residence. The people of Begash buried their dead first in <a href="cist">cist</a> and later in <a href="kurgan">kurgan</a> burials. So far, the earliest direct evidence for domesticated grains in Central Asia can be found at Begash, with the earliest evidence for the presence of both domesticated free-threshing <a href="wheat">wheat</a> (from West Asia) and <a href="broomcorn%20millet">broomcorn millet</a> (from East Asia). 


Direct <a href="Radiocarbon_dating%23Accelerator%20mass%20spectrometry">AMS dating</a> of broomcorn millet and wheat seeds from Begash date to around 2460-2150 BC. Most of the seeds were recovered from cist burials, with very few seeds being recovered from hearths. As almost all of the seeds came from burial contexts, the domesticated wheat and millet was most likely primarily used only for ritual purposes.

Free threshing wheat, either "<a href="Triticum%20aestivum">Triticum aestivum</a>" or "<a href="Triticum%20turgidum">Triticum turgidum</a>", and broomcorn millet were found in all of the cultural layers at Begash.

The early wheat seeds from Begash were small, compact and round. The seeds are morphologically similar to modern Indian dwarf wheat and were similar to the seeds found in early China. The domesticated grains at Begash were not cultivated locally and were likely obtained through trade. Located near the <a href="Dzungarian%20Alatau">Dzungarian Alatau</a>, Begash is situated along the way on what is described as the "wheat road", a route of likely transmission of wheat and other goods from Western Asia to China.

Most of the animal remains at Begash came from domesticated animals. Starting from the earliest period at Begash, sheep and goat remains were found most frequently, and remained the primary animal remains found at Begash throughout its entire history. Over time, cattle slowly began to increase and eventually became the third most commonly found domesticated animal remains at Begash. Surprisingly, the presence of horse remains remained rather low at Begash throughout its history, although the presence of horse remains did gradually increase over time, especially from the Iron Age onwards. The people of Begash relied mostly on herding, supplemented by limited hunting.

The Green Ring

The Green Ring () is a four-act play by <a href="Zinaida%20Gippius">Zinaida Gippius</a> written in January 1914 and premiered at the <a href="Alexandrinsky%20Theatre">Alexandrinsky Theatre</a> on 18 February 1915, directed by <a href="Vsevolod%20Meyerhold">Vsevolod Meyerhold</a>. The <a href="Moscow%20Art%20Theatre">Moscow Art Theatre</a> production, directed by Vakhtang Mchedelov, opened on 7 December 1916. The play was first published in <a href="Petrograd">Petrograd</a> in 1916 by the Ogni Publishers.

The Green Ring, a play about 'fathers and sons' of the new generation, was written in January 1914. In 1933 Gippius remembered: "It was about the pre-War youth, the teenagers of the time. The concocted storyline aside, it all came out of my own communication with the young people of Saint Petersburg, the ones who attended my 'Sundays'."

As the director <a href="Vsevolod%20Meyerhold">Vsevolod Meyerhold</a> and the Alexandrinka cast started to rehearse the play, the major setback occurred. The play had to be taken through the Theatrical Committee. "Since Merezhkovsky was a member of it in Saint Petersburg, we sent it anonymously to its Moscow department. To our utter amazement the local old geezers, while praising its literary merits, refused to accept it as 'immoral', on the grounds that children there read <a href="Hegel">Hegel</a> and behave without proper respect to their elders," Gippius wrote in her 1933 memoirs. "This was scandalous. The director instantly wanted to see this joke of a protocol, we started to think of how to appease these old men with as little fuss as possible. Then the <a href="World%20War%20I">War</a> broke out, everything turned upside down, I stopped even thinking of plays," she remembered in her "Blue Book" of memoirs. "...Then, before Christmas, something extraordinary happened. <a href="Maria%20Savina">Savina</a> who'd read my play (which Meyerhold had sent her) decided she was eager to have a part in it!.. There was not much to play for her in it, the part of an ageing youngish mother was small and confined to just one single act, although it was hardly an easy one... But whatever the queen of Alexandrinka demands, is hers for the taking! And the whole thing has got a re-start."

Savina insisted upon meeting the author and, much to Gippius surprise, subjected her to detailed questioning as to the nature of her character. "Apparently Gippius' play had awakened in her deep memories of the youth spent in a dysfunctional family, with her own mother, no dissimilar to Elena Ivanovna," the theatre historian Irina Arzamastseva suggested. Gippius enjoyed these conversations a lot. In her memoirs on Savina she remarked how off-stage the actress was so much more intriguing and exciting than even when actually acting.

"The Green Ring" was not the first Russian play to feature troubled teenagers. It's 'spiritual' predecessor was considered to be "<a href="Spring%20Awakening%20%28play%29">Spring Awakening</a>" by <a href="Frank%20Wedekind">Frank Wedekind</a>, staged and directed in 1907 by Vsevolod Meyerhold. Later critics found parallels in it to <a href="Ivan%20Turgenev">Ivan Turgenev</a>'s "<a href="A%20Month%20in%20the%20Country%20%28play%29">A Month in the Country</a>", in which the very young Savina excelled as Verochka, notably in her 1879 benefit showcase. Not only did Gippius' play look like a development of Turgenev's ideas concerning the right of the youngsters to make their own decisions in life, but it was also close to it stylistically, having been described as the psychological drama with elements of satire and featuring fragments written as if they were pieces of prose. Also, the play's storyline echoed those of the Christmas tale "Young Heroine" (Маленькая героиня) by the children's author <a href="Alexander%20Fyodorov-Davydov">Alexander Fyodorov-Davydov</a>, as well as, to some extent, "Netochka Nezvanova" by <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoyevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a>, both featuring a 'strong schoolgirl' who arrives into the adult world to bring to it radical change.

Finochka, an emotionally disturbed 16-year-old expelled from a gymnasium for violent behaviour, lives in <a href="Saratov">Saratov</a> with Elena Ivanovna, her neurasthenic mother, slowly recuperating after a botched suicide attempt.

She arrives at Moscow (with her mother who needs medical treatment) and visits her father Vozhzhin in his place which he shares with a middle-aged journalist friend Uncle Mika. The latter has no place of his own, "has lost interest in life" and now seeks solace in co-hosting a circle of schoolchildren, friends of Seryozha (the son of Vozhzhin's female partner Anna Dmitriyevna who lives next door) and his own niece Rusya, calling themselves The Green Ring. Finochka arranges for her parents' meeting, Vozhzhin is determined now that the girl should live with him.

The boys and girls of the Green Ring are engaged in earnest (even not entirely congruous) discussions, trying to find their own ways to sort out their future. Determined to break up with the corrupt world they live in, they decide they should be 'lenient' and 'merciful' towards the old and will build up their own new world having taken from the past only things that matter.

Finochka, shaken by the scandal given her by jealous Elena Ivanovna who hates the idea of being left alone (and whose 'suicide' now appears to be more like a 'botched fake', intended to draw sympathy from her ex-husband) is eagerly accepted by the Ring. Its members are now keen to help out of the domestic hell the girl who is now in such a bad way that she steals her mother's revolver, even if still being unsure, apparently, as to how she's going to use it. More distress is caused when Vozhzhin tells Anna Dmitriyevna that's he is through with her, while the girl is shocked to learn that her father has a lover who lives next door. 

Finally, the Ring hits upon a radical solution for Finochka's troubles: she is to enter the marriage of convenience with Uncle Mika, her father's flatmate. This way she will be able to stay with her dad, attend regularly the meetings of the Green Ring (which she's turned dependent on, too) and bring her own mother in too, so that she won't be left alone.

Uncle Mika, slowly succumbing to his young friends' scheme, is torn by conflicting emotions. Marveling at how his teenage friends have decided his fate for him, he still wonders if this new generation of 'idealists' whom he'd been doting on (and always expressed his desire to be 'useful' to), haven't turned a bit too pragmatic for his liking, by inventing for him such a peculiar 'use'.


The play premiered at the <a href="Alexandrinsky%20Theatre">Alexandrinsky Theatre</a> on 18 February 1915, directed by <a href="Vsevolod%20Meyerkhold">Vsevolod Meyerkhold</a>. The premiere, according to Gippius, was 
"nothing out of the ordinary. Some were raving with delight, others spat hatred, and the press got berserk. Gippius, Meyerhold, Savina! - what's not to get mad over, especially when the censorship is so fierce, there is little else to write about?.. Savina played of course her own heroine, not mine, but did it brilliantly." The author (like many reviewers) noted the extraordinary Second Act with its masterfully staged 'youth assembly'.

According to Arzamastseva, a host of hidden conflicts and undercurrents marked this rather troubled Alexandrinka production. The part of the 16-year-old Finochka was somewhat inexplicably given to Alexandrinka's second prima, Ekaterina Roshchina-Insarova, who was 32 at the time. It was her interpretation of the part, bearing strong resemblance to Savina's 1880s Verochka from "A Month in the Country", that upset the critics most, who hated the "horrid theatricality" of some scenes.

Savina, not just a turn of the centuries Russian theatre superstar, but also the legendary 'Turgenev's last true love' has been following Stanislavski throughout the 1900s trying (unsuccessfully) to convince him she could be useful to his MAT troupe, making much of her 'Turgenev connection'. Her having the Elena Ivanovna's part in the Alexandrinka's production promised to become a statement of defiance and provide the final chord to her artistic career. Indeed, this happened to become the final part for the actress, who died in November 1915.

Gippius too, apparently, had her own old 'unsettled scores' with Stanislavki in mind. In 1904, as Anton Krainy, she panned both Alexandrinka and Moscow Art Theatre for what she saw as their 'overdramatized' attitude towards Russian classics. She chose the Stanislavski-directed "Cherry Orchard" as an example, concentrating on this play's young characters. "The Green Ring" for Gippius looked like an attempt to finally implement her own views on how the new generation of young people should be portrayed on stage. "In this respect Finochka looks like the lost child of Chekhov's last dysfunctional loafers, a daughter of 'the eternal student' and the degraded landlady [Ranevskaya]," the critic argued.

This, as well as a host of smaller matters, gave the press a lot to insinuate about. More ominous and significant, bearing in mind the political context, was the 'German factor'. In the days when another wave of anti-decadence campaign (and Gippius's reputation of a 'decadent' lingered on) coincided with the wave of jingoistic feelings, with calls being given in the press to throw all ethnic Germans out of Russia, the play by Gippius (who was half-German) looked close to Wedekind's "Spring Awakening" which Meyerhold (another German) directed in 1907. The attacks from the 'patriotic' camp continued throughout the play's run in Alexandrinka. The final straw was provided by the article in "<a href="Novoye%20Vremya%20%28newspaper%29">Novoye Vremya</a>" by <a href="Viktor%20Burenin">Viktor Burenin</a> who, while ignoring the play as such, launched a personal attack on the Merezhkovskys and Filosofov. After that the play was performed only once, on 22 April.

In her Afterword to the 1916 Ogni edition Gippius described "The Green Ring" as a "dream play", consciously 'underwritten' so as to provide little more than guidelines "for actors yet unborn..." According to the author, "Meyerhold totally understood [this], while Savina perceived the play as nothing more than a chance to grab this precious part and create another beautiful character to add to her gallery." In Alexandrinka, the director failed to build anything 'revolutionary' out of this material. Instead, it flourished in the Moscow Art Theatre's Second Studio production, where the directors and young cast used its sparseness to the full extent, according to the (then) art critic <a href="Lev%20Vygotsky">Lev Vygotsky</a>.

On 7 December 1916 The Moscow Art Theatre Second Studio opened with the premiere of "The Green Ring", directed by <a href="Vakhtang%20Mchedelov">Vakhtang Mchedelov</a> (Stanislavki conducting several final rehearsals), featuring <a href="Alexey%20Stakhovich">Alexey Stakhovich</a> as Uncle Mika, <a href="Alla%20Tarasova">Alla Tarasova</a> as Finochka, Sofia Holliday as Zoya, <a href="Nikolai%20Batalov">Nikolai Batalov</a> as Petya, and Nina Litovtseva as Elena Ivanovna, among others.

The inclusion of it in the repertoire was itself a controversial decision, for the material differed radically from two other children's play that it had, "Firebird" and "Tom Sawyer". The Mchedelov-directed project in which all the teenagers' parts were to be played by real teenagers, looked from the start like a doomed affair. All the more astounding was its enormous success.

The Second Studio premiere was a triumph, according to the actor and the Studio administrator Vsevolod Verbitsky. "The public for five minutes was calling for the director, but [Mchedelov], being an extremely shy man, preferred to hide away," he remembered.

Central to the history of this production was the inspired performance given by the 18-year old Alla Tarasova, whose choice for the role of Finochka, the emotionally troubled heroine, proved to be a contentious issue right from the start. Greatly disappointed with it was, for one, Nina Litovtseva, who played the girl's mother. Giving credit to the young Tarasova as being an undeniably gifted actress, she still deemed her unattractive and cold, wanting in charisma, something that many 'charmful' young actresses of the Second Studio had in abundance.

She confided her doubts to Alexey Stakhovich, cast in the role of Uncle Mika, who in turn got much distressed, by the fellow veteran's failure to see how perfectly the angular 'ugly duckling' fitted into the role. Indeed, Finochka had to be a 'perfect androgyn', in equal parts childish, womanly and masculine, full of well-balanced inner strength. Tarasova was exactly that," argued Arzamastseva.

Tarasova's performance, lauded by the critics, kickstarted what has been described as 'The Finochka Cult' in Moscow. "Never in my life have I seen such an embodiment of clarity, serenity and chastity on stage. Her quiet grey eyes looked straight into the soul of mine. And that was not just myself: hundreds, then thousands of people rushed to MAT to see her on stage and soon it seemed as if the whole Moscow has fell under the spell of Tarasova's Finochka," the theatre critic Vadim Shverubovich remembered.

"The Green Ring" ran in the Moscow Art Theatre up until 1922, which was in itself remarkable, considering that Stakhovich had committed suicide, outraged by the atrocities of the new regime, and the Merezhkovskys left the country in December 1919 to become extremely harsh critics of the Bolsheviks. Gippius later expressed great regret with the fact that she failed to see the production which, she knew from many people who wrote to her "something quite outstanding." "There it was a completely different matter, for the real 17-year-old teenagers were engaged in it... We were sent photographs, invitations to their 100th run but how could we, in the times like those?" she wrote in her memoirs.

"The Green Ring" was revived on stage in 1933 in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> and <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, as well as <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, where the teenage actors of the Mchedelov-directed production were now cast as the adults, like Vera Grech, once a schoolgirl, now Elena Ivanovna, the troubled mother.

The play divided the critics the majority of whom left negative reviews, although later, in retrospect, it received a more sympathetic treatment. This had been predicted by <a href="Dmitry%20Merezhkovsky">Dmitry Merezhkovsky</a> who, writing for the 1 March 1915 issue of "Birzhevye Vedomosti" (Stockbroker's News) suggested that "the opinions will be polarized due not to the generations' divide portrayed in the play, but rather the schism that exists in the public and among the so-called critics."

Alexey Gvozdev criticized the author's "cold, strictly intellectual approach to life, which freezes the thought lifeless in abstract schemes," and "the false joys of optimistic hope for 'happy Renaissance'," – the drawbacks which in his opinion "stifled even the possibility of there being created in it some lively characters." A. Lyubimov in "Nashi Dni" called the play "faulty, dull and talentless," while A. Chebotaryova described it as "mawkish, preposterous and tendentious."

Nikolai Asheshov in the March 1915 issue of "Sovremenny Mir" called "The Green Ring" "completely unripe play" while <a href="Viktor%20Burenin">Viktor Burenin</a> expressed his attitude towards the production by calling his "<a href="Novoye%20Vremya%20%28newspaper%29">Novoye Vremya</a>" review "The Triumph of Failure" (Торжество провала).

<a href="Lyubov%20Gurevich">Lyubov Gurevich</a> (in "Retch") while giving the author some credit for championing the notions of personal freedom and 'lenience’, as well as "having faith in the unity of the people," considered the play 'schematic' and 'tendentious'. This, in her opinion, prevented Meyerhold from "making the action look as real and simple as, apparently, the author might have wished to see it." The similar view was expressed by Elena Koltonovskaya who noted that the play, "written by a gifted and intelligent author," was still 'concocted', 'arty' and far removed from reality.

Another "Retch"-published review praised the play for "addressing the future" while "digging deep into the issues of today". Signed D.F., it obviously belonged to <a href="Dmitry%20Filosofov">Dmitry Filosofov</a>, a close friend of the Merezhkovskys. Both sympathetic and optimistic was the review by the young <a href="Nikolai%20Slonimsky">Nikolai Slonimsky</a> who expressed his delight with the way "The Green Ring" totally succeeded both in "highlighting all the most urgent questions" and "suggesting the new, exciting answers, providing the material for endless discussions."

Several reviewers, including Gurevich, noted the way Meyerhold had for once abandoned his experimentations and, by trying to totally serve the purpose of the play, has probably saved the production from being the utter disaster. The second act with its impressive scene of the whole of the Green Ring meeting, masterfully staged by the director, has been seen by many as the centerpiece of the production at the Alexandrinka.

Writing for Gorky's "Letopis" in February 1917 <a href="Lev%20Vygotsky">Lev Vygotsky</a> (the future renowned psychologist, then a theatre critic) made much of the text's sparseness which enabled the cast to create the masterpiece of their own out of it. "The play, totally non-engaging in itself, enjoys total re-birth in theatre... turning into something quite captivating. Somehow all its weaknesses disappear, the author's personality vanishes, and all the things 'underwritten' and only sketched get a new life on stage... In through those holes left by the author unfilled, the actors bring in each something of their own." The critic described the production as the great victory of the Second Studio over "this stiltedness that has become common for all children's parts in theatre... The major secret of the [actual] Green Ring, according to the author, is the 'joy of togetherness', and that is exactly what the secret of this whole production turned out to be," the critic asserted.

<a href="Georgy%20Chulkov">Georgy Chulkov</a>, writing in 1922, praised the play (which he called 'bizarre') as highly exiting and original, "defying aesthetic characterizations." He found the charm of the play in its "overwhelming sense of direction," with "the author's soul engaged in a flight." "[Gippius's] disgust with the [modern forms] of 'marriage and famuily' is so sheer and intense in "The Green Ring", there's almost something monastic about it," he opined, going so far as to interpret it as a true implementation of the "be like children" testament.

While the contemporary critics' reaction was in many ways determined by the political climate in Russia at the time, more recent reviewers approached it bearing a broader social and artistic context in mind. According to Temira Pachmus, "The central idea and the secret of "The Green Ring" is the joy of the social instinct." The Russian literary historian Irina Arzamastseva analyzed the play in he context of her own concept of "Three ages of a Russian Schoolgirl" (that was how she called her essay), trying to trace the development of a Russian woman from the Turgenev type of the 1840 ('pure', naive and courageous), through the emancipated, art-loving lady (the actress Maria Savina as an epitome), to the early 20th century's 'a girl with a revolver'.

International Design Conference in Aspen (IDCA)

Founded by <a href="Walter%20Paepcke">Walter Paepcke</a> and <a href="Egbert%20Jacobson">Egbert Jacobson</a> in 1951, the International Design Conference at Aspen (IDCA) brought together many of the era’s most respected designers, artists, architects, and business leaders to discuss and exchange ideas about the synergy between design and business.

By 1970 the IDCA had become an integral part of the design community as an institution and key event for designers on an international scale. At the 1970 conference, Students represented a larger portion than ever before, making up at least 175 of the 625 registered conferees. Given the social and political climate of the time, student attendees were dissatisfied with the uni-directional format of the conference, rejecting the passive role as seated audience members amongst individual speakers, especially when campuses across the country were experimenting with revolutionary educational tactics. Additionally, the theme of the 1970 IDCA, titled "Environment by Design," resulted in a collision of thought between the students and board members: While the board members conception of "environment" centered around the man-made, the students and environmentalists adversely called for a need to protect earth's natural resources. The opposing idealogical views and difficult communication led to an ultimate schism between the IDCA board members and students.

The 1971 conference embraced the issues prevalent in the 1970 conference and adjusted its format accordingly with fewer presentations, less formal papers, and more sessions. The impact of the 1970 conference could be felt from then on, making for a more extensive understanding of design at future conferences.

Docia Kisseih

Docia Angelina Naki Kisseih (1919 – 2008) was a leading <a href="Ghana">Ghanaian</a> nurse, midwife and educator. She was the first Ghanaian to be the country's Chief Nursing Officer after <a href="History%20of%20Ghana">British colonial rule</a> ended. She was influential in pioneering developments in nursing and nursing education, and in her fifties she began university lecturing while studying to become the first nurse in Ghana with a doctoral degree. She also took on leadership roles in a number of professional organisations.

Born on 13 August 1919 at <a href="Odumase">Odumase</a>, Manya Krobo, her early education was at local <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> schools that had been established by European missionaries: first an infant school and then <a href="Krobo%20Girls%20Senior%20High%20School">Krobo Girls Senior High School</a>. In her teens she sometimes accompanied her grandmother, a midwife, when she went to deliver a baby. She spent three years at <a href="Achimota%20School">Achimota School</a> where she obtained her Cambridge Higher School Certificate in 1938, and in 1940 she enrolled at the <a href="Korle%20Bu">Korle Bu</a> maternity hospital for three years of nursing training with an emphasis on midwifery. There had been cultural barriers that discouraged young women in Ghana from becoming nurses, while being a midwife was more easily acceptable. The first State Registered Nurses’ Training College was opened in Ghana in 1945.

In 1943 Kisseih embarked on more than thirty years of professional nursing and further training. Since nursing education in Ghana was not yet fully developed, in order to be eligible for senior posts under colonial rule she had to spend some time in the 1950s training for further qualifications in England. In 1961 she was made Chief Nursing Officer of the newly independent Ghana: her job title inherited from the earlier British system. Kisseih wanted to work towards having some university graduates within the nursing profession. As a first step a two-year "post-basic" diploma program to train nursing educators and administrators was established in 1963 through a threeway agreement between the <a href="World%20Health%20Organisation">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO), <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> and the Ghanaian government. It attracted nurses from other English-speaking countries in the region as well as from within Ghana. At the same time she oversaw a move away from the traditional British hospital-based system to a more community-based kind of healthcare better suited to Ghanaian society. She developed a new curriculum for nurses, sponsored by the WHO, which emphasised public health and community nursing care with good support for maternal and child health. Kisseih also established a scholarship fund for some nurses to train abroad until a more in-depth education was available locally.

Between 1975 and 1981 she was a lecturer in the Department of Nursing of the <a href="University%20of%20Ghana">University of Ghana</a> while also preparing for her 1980 doctorate at <a href="Boston%20University">Boston University</a> in the USA., which made her the first nurse in Ghana with a post-graduate degree. 1980 saw the beginning of the first four-year bachelor's degree in nursing at the university's <a href="Legon">Legon</a> campus. She "transformed and modernised nursing education" with "strong imaginative leadership and initiative", according to the citation accompanying an honorary Doctor of Laws degree conferred on her 89th birthday. It went on to say she had been determined that standards should be high after the post-independence departure of qualified nurses from overseas.

Kisseih was the founder and first president of the Ghana Registered Nurses Association (GRNA) formed in 1960 by a merger of two other nursing bodies, one led by her. She also served on the National Health Planning Committee and the Nurses and Midwives Board. She was an African representative to, and a worldwide committee member of, the <a href="International%20Council%20of%20Nurses">International Council of Nurses</a> and was their vice-president from 1973-77. She was also involved in voluntary organisations like the Ghana <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> Society, the <a href="Girl%20Guides">Girl Guides</a>, the <a href="St.%20John%20Ambulance">St. John Ambulance</a> Association, the St John's Council of Ghana and the Manya Krobo Youth Congress. She was honoured by the state in 1984 and in 1986 her portrait was put on the 100 <a href="Ghanaian%20cedi">cedi</a> banknote.

Her honorary degree was conferred ceremonially at Docia Kisseih's home because of her frailty and she died later that month, in August 2008. In 2015 the GRNA instituted a series of lectures to be called the Dr Docia Kisseih Memorial Lectures.

M.M. Rhodes and Sons Company

The M.M. Rhodes and Sons Company is a historical <a href="button">button</a> factory complex at 12 Porter Street in <a href="Taunton%2C%20Massachusetts">Taunton, Massachusetts</a>. Established in 1861 and operational until 2014, it was one of the first successful button manufacturers in the United States. Its surviving factory complex is one of the last early 20th-century complexes left on Taunton's once heavily industrialized south side. The complex was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2016.

The Rhodes Company factory is a complex of seven connected buildings, occupying on the southeast side of Porter Street, southwest of downtown Taunton. Its main building, constructed in 1880, is a long three-story brick structure oriented perpendicular to the street. The other buildings of the complex are attached to this one, roughly forming a U shape with a central courtyard that is open to Porter Street. The oldest building on the site, which predates its use as a button factory, is a c. 1850 wood frame building that extends along Porter Street southwest of the main building.

The M.M. Rhodes and Sons Company was founded in 1861 by Marcus Morton Rhodes, when he first began renting space on this site. Rhodes manufactured a variety of items, including parts for hoop skirts and a variety of nails. He eventually designed a button-making machine, and this became one of the mainstays of the company business after supplies from <a href="France">France</a> were cut off by the 1870 <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>. This prompted him to enlarge the physical plant, building the main plant that served the company until its closure in 2014. It remained a family-run business during this entire period.
